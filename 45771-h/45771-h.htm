<p class="center">IMPOSTURE AND HISTORY OF THE MORMONS.</p>


<p>Among the many extraordinary chapters
in the history of the Nineteenth Century
none will seem in the next age more incredible
and curious than that in which is related
the Rise and Progress of Mormonism. The
creed of the Latter Day Saints, as they style
themselves, is not, indeed, more absurd and
ridiculous than that of the Millerites, but this
last sect had but a very brief existence, and
is now almost forgotten; while the imposture
of Smith and his associates, commencing before
Miller began his prophecies, is still successful,
and represented by missionaries in
almost every state throughout the world.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been observed with some reason, that
had a Rabelais or a Swift told the story of the
Mormons under the veil of allegory, the sane
portion of mankind would probably have entered
a protest against the extravagance of
the satirist. The name of the mock hero, his
own and his family's ignorance and want of
character, the low cunning of his accomplices,
the open and shameless vices in which they
indulged, and the extraordinary success of the
sect they founded, would all have been thought
too obviously conceived with a view to ludicrous
effects. Yet the Mormon movement
has assumed the condition of an important
popular feature, and after much suffering and
many reverses, its authors have achieved a
condition of eminent industrial prosperity. In
twenty years the company, consisting of the
impostor and his father and brother, has increased
to nearly half a million; they occupy
one of the richest portions of this continent,
have a regularly organized government,
and are represented in the Congress of the
United States by a delegate having all the
powers usually conferred on the members for
territories. With missions in every part of
the country, in every capital of Europe, in
Mecca, in Jerusalem, and among the islands
of the Pacific and the Indian Oceans, all of
whom are charged with the duty of making
converts and gathering them to the Promised
Land of Deseret, they must very soon have
a population sufficiently large to claim admission
as an equal member to the Union,
and perhaps to hold the balance of power in
its affairs.</p>

<p>To illustrate the energy and success with
which their missions are prosecuted, we may
cite the statement contained in a work just
published in London, <i>The Mormons, or Latter
Day Saints, a Contemporary History</i>, that
more than fourteen thousand persons have left
Great Britain since 1840 for the "Holy City."
The emigrants passing through Liverpool in
1849, amounted to 2,500, generally of the
better class of mechanics and farmers, and it
was estimated that at least 30,000 converts
remained behind. In June, 1850, there were
in England and Scotland, 27,863, of whom
London contributed 2,529; Liverpool, 1,018;
Manchester, 2,787; Glasgow, 1,846; Sheffield,
1,920; Edinburgh, 1,331; Birmingham,
1,909; and Wales, 4,342. And the Mormon
census was again taken last January, giving
the entire number in the British Isles at 30,747.
In fourteen years, more than 50,000
had been baptized in England, of whom nearly
17,000 had "emigrated to Zion." Although
the Mormon emigration is commonly of the
better class, there are also poor Mormons;
and that these as well as their more prosperous
brethren may be "gathered to the
holy city," there is now amassed in Liverpool
a very large fund, under the control of officers
appointed by the "Apostles," destined exclusively
for the equipment and transportation
of converts to their place of Refuge.</p>

<p>The interest which recent events have attracted
to the community in Deseret or Utah,
will render interesting a more particular survey
of its origin, progress, and condition.</p>

<p>In 1825 there lived near the village of Palmyra,
in New-York, a family of small farmers
of the name of Smith. They were of bad
repute in the neighborhood, notorious for being
continually in debt, and heedless of their
business engagements. The eldest son, Joseph,
says one of his friends, "could read
without much difficulty, wrote a very imperfect
hand, and had a very limited understanding
of the elementary rules of arithmetic."
Associated in some degree with Sidney Rigdon,
who comes before us in the first place as
a journeyman printer, he was the founder
of the new faith. The early history of the
conspiracy of these worthies is imperfectly
known; but it is evident that Rigdon must
have been in Smith's confidence from the
first. Rigdon, indeed, probably had more to
do with the matter than even Smith; but it
was the latter who was first put conspicuously
forward, and who managed to retain the
pre-eminence. The account of the pretended
revelation, as given by Smith, is as follows:
He all at once found himself laboring in a
state of great darkness and wretchedness of
mind&mdash;was bewildered among the conflicting
doctrines of the Christians, and could find no
comfort or rest for his soul. In this state, he
resorted to earnest prayer, kneeling in the
woods and fields, and after long perseverance
was answered by the appearance of a bright
light in heaven, which gradually descended
until it enveloped the worshipper, who found
himself standing face to face with two supernatural
beings. Of these he inquired which
was the true religion? The reply was, that
all existing religions were erroneous, but that
the pure doctrine and crowning dispensation
of Christianity should at a future period be
miraculously revealed to himself. Several
similar visitations ensued, and at length he
was informed that the North American Indians
were a remnant of Israel; that when
they first entered America they were a powerful
and enlightened people; that their priests
and rulers kept the records of their history
and doctrines, but that, having fallen off from
the true worship, the great body of the nation
were supernaturally destroyed&mdash;not, however,
until a priest and prophet named Mormon,
had, by heavenly direction, drawn up an
abstract of their records and religious opinions.
He was told that this still existed,
buried in the earth, and that he was selected
as the instrument for its recovery and manifestation
to all nations. The record, it was
said, contained many prophecies as to these
latter days, and instructions for the gathering
of the saints into a temporal and spiritual
kingdom, preparatory to the second coming
of the Messiah, which was at hand. After
several very similar visions, the spot in which
the book lay buried was disclosed. Smith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
went to it, and after digging, discovered a
sort of box, formed of upright and horizontal
flags, within which lay a number of plates
resembling gold, and of the thickness of common
tin. These were bound together by a
wire, and were engraved with Egyptian characters.
By the side of them lay two transparent
stones, called by the ancients, "Urim
and Thummim," set in "the two rims of a
bow." These stones were divining crystals,
and the angels informed Smith, that by using
them he would be enabled to decipher the
characters on the plates. What ultimately
became of the plates&mdash;if such things existed
at all&mdash;does not appear. They were said to
have been seen and handled by eleven witnesses.
With the exception of three persons,
these witnesses were either members of
Smith's family, or of a neighboring family of
the name of Whitmer. The Smiths, of course,
give suspicious testimony. The Whitmers
have disappeared, and no one knows any thing
about them. Another witness, Oliver Cowdrey,
was afterwards an amanuensis to Joseph;
and another, Martin Harris, was long
a conspicuous disciple. There is some confusion,
however, about this person. Although
he signs his name, as a witness who has seen
and handled the plates, he assured Professor
Anthon that he never had seen them, that
"he was not sufficiently pure of heart," and
that Joseph refused to show him the plates,
but gave him instead a transcript on paper
of the characters engraved on them. It is
difficult to trace the early advances of the imposture.
Every thing is vague and uncertain.
We have no dates, and only the statements
of the prophet and his friends.</p>

<p>Meantime, Smith must have worked successfully
on the feeble and superstitious mind
of Martin Harris. This man, as we have just
said, received from him a written transcript
of the mysterious characters, and conveyed it
to Professor Anthon, a competent philological
authority. Dr. Anthon's account of the
interview is one of the most important parts
of the entire history. Harris told him he
had not seen the plates, but that he intended
to sell his farm and give the proceeds to enable
Smith to publish a translation of them.
This statement, with what follows, shows
that Smith's original intention, <i>quoad</i> the alleged
plates, was to use them as a means for
swindling Harris. The Mormons have published
accounts of Professor Anthon's judgment
on the paper submitted to him, which
he himself states to be "perfectly false."
The Mormon version of the interview represents
Dr. Anthon "as having been unable to
decipher the characters correctly, but as having
presumed that, if the original records
could be brought, he could assist in translating
them." On this statement being made,
Dr. Anthon described the document submitted
to him as having been a sort of <i>pot-pourri</i>
of ancient marks and alphabets. "It had
evidently been prepared by some person who
had before him a book containing various alphabets;
Greek and Hebrew letters, crosses
and flourishes, Roman letters, inverted or
placed sideways, were arranged in perpendicular
columns, and the whole ended in a
rude delineation of a circle, divided into various
compartments, decked with numerous
strange marks, and evidently copied after the
Mexican Calendar given by Humboldt, but
copied in such a way as not to betray the
source whence it was derived." This account
disposes of the statement that the characters
were Egyptian, while the very jumble
of the signs of different nations, languages,
and ages, proves that the impostor was deficient
both in tact and knowledge. The
scheme seems to have been, at all events, <i>in
petto</i> when Smith communicated with Harris;
but a satisfactory clue to the fabrication is
lost in our ignorance of the time and circumstances
under which Smith and Rigdon came
together. It must have been subsequent to
that event that the "translation," by means
of the magic Urim and Thummim, was begun.
This work Smith is represented as
having labored at steadily, assisted by Oliver
Cowdrey, until a volume was produced containing
as much matter as the Old Testament,
written in the Biblical style, and containing,
as Smith said the Angel had informed him, a
history of the lost tribes in their pilgrimage
to and settlement in America, with copious
doctrinal and prophetic commentaries and revelations.</p>

<p>The devotion of Harris to the impostor secured
a fund sufficient for defraying the cost
of printing the pretended revelation, and the
sect began slowly to increase. The doctrines
of Smith were not at first very clearly defined;
it is probable that neither he nor Rigdon
had determined what should be their
precise character; but like their early contemporary
the prophet Matthias (the interesting
history of whose career was published
in New-York several years ago by the late
Colonel Stone), they had no hesitation in deciding
on one cardinal point, that the revelations
made to Smith at any time should be
received with unquestioning and implicit
faith, and the earliest of these revelations
contemplated a liberal provision for all the
prophet's personal necessities. Thus, in February,
1831, it was revealed to the disciples
that they should immediately build the prophet
a house; on another occasion it was enjoined
that, if they had any regard for their
own souls, the sooner they provided him
with food and raiment, and every thing he
needed, the better it would be for them; and
in a third revelation, Joseph was informed
that "he was not to labor for his living."
All these "revelations" were received, and
though the impostor seemed to intelligent
men little better than a buffoon, his followers
soon learned to regard him as almost
deserving of adoration, and he began to revel
in whatever luxury and profligacy was most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
agreeable to his vulgar taste and ambition.
As in the case of the scarcely more respectable
pretender, Andrew Jackson Davis, it was
asserted that his original want of cultivation
precluded the notion of his having by
the exercise of any natural or acquired faculties
produced his "revelations." Everywhere
his followers said, "The prophet is
not learned in a human sense: how could he
have become acquainted with all the antiquarian
learning here displayed, if it were not
supernaturally communicated to him?" But
to this question there was soon an answer
equally explicit and satisfactory. The real
author of the Book of Mormon was a Rev.
Solomon Spaulding, who wrote it as a romance.
Its entire history and the means by which it
came into the possession of Smith are described,
in the following statement, by Mr.
Spaulding's widow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="caption"><p>CROSSING THE MISSOURI.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Since the <i>Book of Mormon</i>, or <i>Golden Bible</i>
(as it was originally called), has excited much attention,
and is deemed by a certain new sect of
equal authority with the sacred Scriptures, I think
it a duty to the public to state what I know of its
origin.... Solomon Spaulding, to whom I was
married in early life, was a graduate of Dartmouth
college, and was distinguished for a lively
imagination, and great fondness for history. At
the time of our marriage, he resided in Cherry
Valley, New York. From this place, we removed
to New Salem, Ashtabula County, Ohio, sometimes
called Conneaut, as it is situated on Conneaut
Creek. Shortly after our removal to this
place, his health failed, and he was laid aside
from active labors. In the town of New Salem
there are numerous mounds and forts, supposed
by many to be the dilapidated dwellings and fortifications
of a race now extinct. These relics arrest
the attention of new settlers, and become objects
of research for the curious. Numerous implements
were found, and other articles evincing
skill in the arts. Mr. Spaulding being an educated
man, took a lively interest in these developments
of antiquity; and in order to beguile the
hours of retirement, and furnish employment for
his mind, he conceived the idea of giving an historical
sketch of the long-lost race. Their antiquity
led him to adopt the most ancient style, and he
imitated the Old Testament as nearly as possible.
His sole object in writing this imaginary history
was to amuse himself and his neighbors. This
was about the year 1812. Hull's surrender at
Detroit occurred near the same time, and I recollect
the date well from that circumstance. As he
progressed in his narrative, the neighbors would
come in from time to time to hear portions read,
and a great interest in the work was excited
among them. It claimed to have been written by
one of the lost nation, and to have been recovered
from the earth; and he gave it the title of 'The
Manuscript Found.' The neighbors would often
inquire how Mr. Spaulding advanced in deciphering
the manuscript; and when he had a sufficient
portion prepared, he would inform them, and they
would assemble to hear it read. He was enabled,
from his acquaintance with the classics and ancient
history, to introduce many singular names,
which were particularly noticed by the people,
and could be easily recognized by them. Mr. Solomon
Spaulding had a brother, Mr. John Spaulding,
residing in the place at the time, who was
perfectly familiar with the work, and repeatedly
heard the whole of it. From New Salem we removed
to Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania. Here Mr.
Spaulding found a friend and acquaintance, in the
person of Mr. Patterson, an editor of a newspaper.
He exhibited his manuscript to Mr. Patterson,
who was much pleased with it, and borrowed it
for perusal. He retained it a long time, and informed
Mr. Spaulding that if he would make out
a title-page and preface, he would publish it, and
it might be a source of profit. This Mr. Spaulding
refused to do. Sidney Rigdon, who has figured
so largely in the history of the Mormons, was at
that time connected with the printing office of Mr.
Patterson, as is well known in that region, and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
Rigdon himself has frequently stated, became acquainted
with Mr. Spaulding's manuscript, and
copied it. It was a matter of notoriety and interest
to all connected with the printing establishment.
At length the manuscript was returned to
its author, and soon after we removed to Amity,
Washington county, where Mr. Spaulding died, in
1816. The manuscript then fell into my hands,
and was carefully preserved. It has frequently
been examined by my daughter, Mrs. M'Kenstry,
of Monson, Massachusetts, with whom I now reside,
and by other friends. After the Book of
Mormon came out, a copy of it was taken to New
Salem, the place of Mr. Spaulding's former residence,
and the very place where the 'Manuscript
Found' was written. A woman appointed a
meeting there; and in the meeting read copious
extracts from the Book of Mormon. The historical
part was known by all the older inhabitants,
as the identical work of Mr. Spaulding, in which
they had all been so deeply interested years before.
Mr. John Spaulding was present, and recognized
perfectly the production of his brother.
He was amazed and afflicted that it should have
been perverted to so wicked a purpose. His grief
found vent in tears, and he arose on the spot, and
expressed to the meeting his sorrow that the writings
of his deceased brother should be used for a
purpose so vile and shocking. The excitement in
New Salem became so great, that the inhabitants
had a meeting, and deputed Dr. Philastus Hurlbut,
one of their number, to repair to this place,
and to obtain from me the original manuscript of
Mr. Spaulding, for the purpose of comparing it
with the Mormon Bible&mdash;to satisfy their own
minds and to prevent their friends from embracing
an error so delusive. This was in the year 1834.
Dr. Hurlbut brought with him an introduction and
request for the manuscript, which was signed by
Messrs. Henry, Lake, Aaron Wright, and others,
with all of whom I was acquainted, as they were
my neighbors when I resided at New Salem. I
am sure that nothing would grieve my husband
more, were he living, than the use which has been
made of his work. The air of antiquity which
was thrown about the composition doubtless suggested
the idea of converting it to the purposes of
delusion. Thus, an historical romance, with the
addition of a few pious expressions, and extracts
from the sacred Scriptures, has been construed
into a new Bible, and palmed off upon a company
of poor deluded fanatics as Divine."</p></div>

<p>Similar evidence as to the Spaulding MS.
was given by several private friends, and by
the writer's brother, all of whom were familiar
with its contents. The facts thus graphically
detailed have of course been denied, but
have never been disproved. Indeed, without
them it is impossible to explain the hold
which Rigdon always possessed on the Prophet;
for he was a poor creature, without
education and without talents. At one time&mdash;a
critical moment in the history of the new
church&mdash;a quarrel arose between the accomplices;
but it ended in Smith's receiving a "revelation,"
in which Rigdon was raised by divine
command to be equal with himself, having
plenary power given to him to bind and
loose both on earth and in heaven.</p>

</div>

<p>The remaining history of the Mormons is
eminently interesting. Ignorant and superstitious
as have been the chief part of the
disciples, and atrocious as have been the tricks
of the knaves who have led them on amid all
the varieties of their good and evil fortune,
there have occasionally been displayed among
them an enthusiasm and bravery of endurance
that demand admiration. Nearly from the
beginning the leaders of the sect seem to have
contemplated settling in the thinly populated
regions of the western states, where lands
were to be purchased for low prices, and after
a short residence at Kirkland, in Ohio,
they determined to found a New Jerusalem
in Missouri. The interests of the town were
confided to suitable officers, and Smith spent
his time in travelling through the country and
preaching, until the real or pretended immoralities
of the sect led to such discontents that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
in 1839 they were forcibly and lawlessly expelled
from the state. We are inclined to
believe that they were not only treated with
remarkable severity, but that there was not
any reason whatever to justify an interference
in their affairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE MORMON TEMPLE AT NAUVOO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>From Missouri the saints proceeded to Illinois,
and on the sixth of April, 1841, with imposing
ceremonies, laid at their new city of
Nauvoo the corner-stone of the Temple,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> an
immense edifice, without any architectural
order or attraction, which in a few months
was celebrated every where as not inferior in
size and magnificence to that built by Solomon
in Jerusalem. Nauvoo is delightfully
situated in the midst of a fertile district, and
a careful inquirer will not be apt to deny that
it became the home of a more industrious,
frugal, and generally moral society, than occupied
any other town in the state. Whatever
charges were preferred against Smith
and his disciples, to justify the outrages to
which they were subjected, the history of
their expulsion from Nauvoo is simply a series
of illustrations of the fact that the ruffian
population of the neighboring country
set on foot a vast scheme of robbery in order
to obtain the lands and improvements of the
Mormons without paying for them. We have
not room for a particular statement of the
discontents and conspiracies which grew up in
the city, nor for any detail of the aggressions
from without. On the 27th of June, 1844,
Joseph and Hyrum Smith were murdered,
while under the especial protection of the authorities
of the state. A writer in the <i>Christian
Reflector</i> newspaper, soon after, observed
of Joseph Smith:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Various are the opinions concerning this singular
personage; but whatever may be thought in
reference to his principles, objects, or moral character,
all agree that he was a most remarkable
man.... Notwithstanding the low origin,
poverty, and profligacy of these mountebanks,
they have augmented their numbers till more than
100,000 persons are now numbered among the
followers of the Mormon Prophet, and they never
were increasing so rapidly as at the time of his
death. Born in the very lowest walks of life,
reared in poverty, educated in vice, having no
claims to even common intelligence, coarse and
vulgar in deportment, the Prophet Smith succeeded
in establishing a religious creed, the tenets of
which have been taught throughout America; the
Prophet's virtues have been rehearsed in Europe;
the ministers of Nauvoo have found a welcome in
Asia; Africa has listened to the grave sayings of
the seer of Palmyra; the standard of the Latter-Day
Saints has been reared on the banks of the
Nile; and even the Holy Land has been entered
by the emissaries of this impostor. He founded
a city in one of the most beautiful situations in
the world, in a beautiful curve of the 'Father of
Waters,' of no mean pretensions, and in it he had
collected a population of twenty-five thousand,
from every part of the world. The acts of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>life exhibit a character as incongruous as it is remarkable.
If we can credit his own words and
the testimony of eye-witnesses, he was at the
same time the vicegerent of God and a tavern-keeper&mdash;a
prophet and a base libertine&mdash;a minister
of peace, and a lieutenant-general&mdash;a ruler of
tens of thousands, and a slave to all his own base
passions&mdash;a preacher of righteousness, and a profane
swearer&mdash;a worshipper of Bacchus, mayor
of a city, and a miserable bar-room fiddler&mdash;a
judge on the judicial bench, and an invader of the
civil, social, and moral relations of men; and, notwithstanding
these inconsistencies of character,
there are not wanting thousands willing to stake
their souls' eternal salvation on his veracity. For
aught we know, time and distance will embellish
his life with some new and rare virtues, which his
most intimate friends failed to discover while living
with him. Reasoning from effect to cause, we
must conclude that the Mormon Prophet was of
no common genius: few are able to commence and
carry out an imposition like his, so long, and so
extensively. And we see, in the history of his
success, most striking proofs of the credulity of a
large portion of the human family."</p></div>

by another class of socialists, the Icarians, under M. Cabet,

<div class="caption"><p>THE EXPULSION FROM NAUVOO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After some dissensions, in which the party
of Brigham Young triumphed over that of
Sidney Rigdon, the sect were reorganized and
for some time were permitted quietly to prosecute
their plans at Nauvoo. But early in
1846 they were driven out of their city and
compelled in mid winter to seek a new home
beyond the farthest borders of civilization.
The first companies, embracing sixteen hundred
persons, crossed the Mississippi on the 3d
February, 1846, and similar detachments continued
to leave until July and August, travelling
by ox-teams towards California, then
almost unknown, and quite unpeopled by the
Anglo-Saxon race. Their enemies asserted
that the intention of the Saints was to excite
the Indians against the government, and that
they would return to take vengeance on the
whites for the indignities they had suffered.
Nothing appears to have been further from
their intentions. Their sole object was to
plant their Church in some fertile and hitherto
undiscovered spot, where they might be
unmolested by any opposing sect. The war
against Mexico was then raging, and, to test
the loyalty of the Mormons, it was suggested
that a demand should be made on them to
raise five hundred men for the service of the
country. They consented, and that number
of their best men enrolled themselves under
General Kearney, and marched 2,400 miles
with the armies of the United States. At the
conclusion of the war they were disbanded
in Upper California. They allege that it was
one of this band who, in working at a mill,
first discovered the golden treasures of California;
and they are said to have amassed
large quantities of gold before the secret was
made generally known to the "Gentiles."
But faith was not kept with the Mormons
who remained in Nauvoo. Although they
had agreed to leave in detachments, as rapidly
as practicable, they were not allowed necessary
time to dispose of their property; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
in September, 1846, the city was besieged by
their enemies upon the pretence that they
did not intend to fulfil the stipulations made
with the people and authorities of Illinois.
After a three days' bombardment, the last
remnant was finally driven out.</p>

<p>The terrible hejira of the Mormon emigrants
over the Rocky Mountains has been
described by Mr. Kane of Philadelphia, in an
interesting pamphlet, which is honorable to
his own character for good sense and for benevolent
feeling. No religious emigration
was ever attended by more suffering, no emigration
of any kind was ever prosecuted with
more bravery. It resulted in the permanent
establishment of the "Commonwealth of the
New Covenant," in Utah, or Deseret, one of
the most attractive portions of the interior of
this Continent, near its western border. Of
this territory Mr. Kane says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Deseret is emphatically a new country; new in its
own characteristic features, newer still in its bringing
together within its limits the most inconsistent
peculiarities of other countries. I cannot aptly
compare it to any. Descend from the mountains,
where you have the scenery and climate of Switzerland,
to seek the sky of your choice among the
many climates of Italy, and you may find welling
out of the same hills the freezing springs of Mexico
and the hot springs of Iceland, both together
coursing their way to the Salt Sea of Palestine, in
the plain below. The pages of Malte Brun provide
me with a less truthful parallel to it than
those which describe the Happy Valley of Rasselas,
or the Continent of Ballibarbi.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p>GREAT SALT LAKE CITY OR NEW JERUSAL'M.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The history of the Mormons has ever since
been an unbroken record of prosperity. It
has looked as though the elements of fortune,
obedient to a law of natural re-action, were
struggling to compensate their undue share
of suffering. They may be pardoned for
deeming it miraculous. But, in truth, the
economist accounts for it all, who explains to
us the speedy recuperation of cities, laid in
ruin by flood, fire, and earthquake. During
its years of trial, Mormon labor had subsisted
on insufficient capital, and under many difficulties,
but it <i>has</i> subsisted, and survives them
now, as intelligent and powerful as ever it was
at Nauvoo; with this difference, that it has in
the mean time been educated to habits of unmatched
thrift, energy, and endurance, and
has been transplanted to a situation where it
is in every respect more productive. Moreover,
during all the period of their journey,
while some have gained by practice in handicraft,
and the experience of repeated essays
at their various halting-places, the minds of
all have been busy framing designs and planning
the improvements they have since found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
opportunity to execute. Their territory is
unequalled as a stock-raising country; the
finest pastures of Lombardy are not more estimable
than those on the east side of the
Utah Lake and its tributary rivers, and it is
scarcely less rich in timber and minerals than
the most fortunate portions of the continent.</p>

<p>From the first the Mormons have had little
to do in Deseret, but attend to mechanical
and strictly agricultural pursuits. They have
made several successful settlements; the farthest
north is distant more than forty miles,
and the farthest south, in a valley called the
Sanpeech, two hundred, from that first formed.
A duplicate of the Lake Tiberias empties its
waters into the innocent Dead Sea of Deseret,
by a fine river, which they have named
the Western Jordan. It was on the right
bank of this stream, on a rich table land,
traversed by exhaustless waters falling from
the highlands, that the pioneers, coming out
of the mountains in the night of the 24th of
July, 1847, pitched their first camp in the
Valley, and consecrated the ground. This
spot proved the most favorable site for their
chief settlement, and after exploring the
whole country, they founded on it their city
of the New Jerusalem. Its houses are diffused,
to command as much as possible the
farms, which are laid out in wards or cantons,
with a common fence to each. The
farms in wheat already cover a space nearly
as large as Rhode Island. The houses of New
Jerusalem, or Great Salt Lake City, as it is
commonly called, are distributed over an area
nearly as great as that of New York. The
foundations have been laid for a temple more
vast and magnificent than that which was
erected at Nauvoo. The Deseret News, a
paper established under the direction of the
ecclesiastical authority came to us lately with
several columns descriptive of the fourth anniversary
celebration of the arrival of the disciples
in their Promised Land.</p>

<p>Since the preceding paragraphs were
written some important information has been
received from Utah, justifying apprehensions
that the ambition of the chief of the sect,
and territorial governor, Brigham Young,
will be continually productive of difficulties.
It appears that in consequence of his unwarrantable
assumptions of authority, the larger
and most respectable portion of the territorial
officers, including B. O. Harris, Secretary
of the Territory, G. K. Brandenburg,
Chief Justice, E. P. Bracchas, Associate Justice,
H. R. Day, Indian Agent, and Messrs.
Gillette and Young, were preparing to leave
for the Atlantic States.</p>

<p>The particulars of the difficulty are not
stated, but it is said that $20,000 appropriated
by Congress for territorial purposes had
been squandered by Young, and an attempt
made by him to take $24,000 from the Treasurer,
who refused, and applied to the Court
to support him. This was done, and an injunction
granted restraining the proceedings
of the Governor.</p>

<p>Of the numerous objects of interest with
which the banks of the Thames are so
thickly studded, none are of such surpassing
grandeur and regal magnificence as Windsor
Castle, with its adjacent chapel of St. George,
and Eton College. This massive and stately
pile is richly storied with poetic associations,
and venerable for its antiquity, in having
proudly defied the ravages of Time for some
eight centuries. Here kings were born; here
they kept royal state amid the blaze of fashion
and luxurious indulgence; and here in the
adjoining mausoleum, they were buried. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
deeds of chivalry and high renown that shine
on us from ancient days were enacted; and it
is here the most exemplary of England's monarchy
still prefers to hold her suburban residence.
This brave old fortress, unlike the
Tower of London, with its dark records of
crime, is rife with pleasant memories. Not
only is the edifice itself, with its gigantic
towers, its broad bastions, and its kingly halls,
sacred with incident and story, but Shakespeare
has also rendered classical the very
ground on which it stands.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>DISTANT VIEW OF WINDSOR CASTLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Windsor Forest, with its magnificent old
oaks and its richly variegated scenery, of "upland,
lawn and stream," has afforded a fruitful
theme for the pens of Gray and the poet
of "The Seasons;" and Pope, it will be remembered,
has felicitously pictured forth its
changeful beauties. As far back as the days
of the Saxons we have records of palatial
residence at Old Windsor, or as its name then
was, <i>Windleshora</i>, so called from the windings
of the Thames in its vicinity. William
the Norman built some portions of the Castle,
which, until the time of Richard I., seems
ever to have been the peaceful abode of royalty.
During the civil wars, of which Windsor
was a principal scene, the Castle became the
most important military establishment in the
kingdom. The sanguinary struggles connected
with the signing of <i>Magna Charta</i>, are
familiar to the reader. The birth of Edward
III., which took place at Windsor, forms another
epoch in its history&mdash;that prince having
reconstructed the greater part of the Castle,
and very largely extended it. William of
Wykeham was the architect, with the liberal
salary of a shilling a day. It is said he and
six hundred workmen employed on the building,
at the rate of one penny a day. It was
here Richard II. heard the appeal of high
treason, brought by the Duke of Lancaster
against Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, which
resulted in the former becoming Henry IV.
It was here the Earl of Surrey, imprisoned
for the high crime of eating flesh in Lent, beguiled
his solitude, with his muse; and here
was the last prison of that unfortunate monarch,
Charles I. In Windsor Castle also resided
the haughty Elizabeth; and along
its terrace might have been seen in the days
of the Commonwealth the stern figure of the
lion-hearted Cromwell. It was the residence
of Henry VIII., and the prison of James I.
of Scotland. It is indebted for most of its
modern splendor, to the luxurious taste and
prodigal expenditure of George IV., who
obtained from the House of Commons the
sum of &pound;300,000 for the purpose. The suites
of royal apartments at present in use by the
Queen are superb in the extreme, especially
the state drawing rooms, in which are nine
pictures by Zuccarelli; and St. George's Hall&mdash;a
vast apartment in which the state banquets
are given.</p>

<p>The long walk, extending about three miles
in a direct line to the Palace, presents the
finest vista of its kind in the world. It extends
from the grand entrance of the Castle,
to the top of a commanding hill in the Great
Park, which affords a panoramic view of enchanting
beauty, including many places memorable
in history. On the right is the Thames,
seen beyond Charter Island, and the plain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
Runnymede, where the Barons extorted <i>Magna
Charta</i>, whilst in the hazy distance are
the rising eminences of Harrow and Hampstead.
On the summit of this hill stands the
equestrian statue of George III. Near the
avenue called Queen Elizabeth's Walk, tradition
still points out a withered tree as the
identical oak of "Herne the Hunter," who,
as the tale goes,</p>

<h2>MR. GERARD, THE LION KILLER,</h2>
<p class="center">AND M. LE BARON MUNCHAUSEN, WHO BEAT
HIM.</p>


<p>Jules Gerard is an officer in the famous
army of Africa, who has a passion for lion
killing. He is the Gordon Cumming of
France. He follows lions alone; hunts them
like sheep, for miles; sleeps near them; and
patiently awaits their coming. Last year we
published (article "Wild Sports in Algeria,"
<i>International</i>, vol. ii. p. 121,) an account of
one of his exploits, to which he now refers
us. His last adventure is sufficiently exciting,
and incredibly daring. It is told in a letter
to a friend, and published in the <i>Journal des
Chasseurs</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My dear L&eacute;on,&mdash;In my narrative of the month
of August, 1850, I spoke of a large old lion which
I had not been able to fall in with, and of whose
sex and age I had formed a notion from his roarings.
On the return of the expeditionary column
from Kabylia, I asked permission from General
St. Armand to go and explore the fine lairs situated
on the northern declivity of Mount Aures, in
the environs of Klenchela, where I had left my
animal. Instead of a furlough, I received a mission
for that country, and accordingly had during
two months to shut my ears against the daily reports
that were brought to me by the Arabs of the
misdeeds of the solitary. In the beginning of
September, when my mission was terminated, I
proceeded to pitch my tent in the midst of the
district haunted by the lion, and set about my investigations
round about the <i>douars</i> to which he
paid the most frequent visits. In this manner I
spent many a night beneath the open sky, without
any satisfactory result, when, on the 15th, in the
morning, after a heavy rain which had lasted till
midnight, some natives, who had explored the
cover, came and informed me that the lion was
ensconced within half a league of my tent. I set
out at three o'clock, taking with me an Arab to
hold my horse, another carrying my arms, and a
third in charge of a goat most decidedly unconscious
of the important part it was about to perform.
Having alighted at the skirt of the wood,
I directed myself towards a glade situated in the
midst of the haunt, where I found a shrub to
which I could tie the goat, and a tuft or two to
sit upon. The Arabs went and crouched down
beneath the cover, at a distance of about 100
paces. I had been there about a quarter of an
hour, the goat meanwhile bleating with all its
might, when a covey of partridges got up behind
me, uttering their usual cry when surprised. I
looked about me in every direction, but could see
nothing. Meanwhile the goat had ceased crying,
and its eyes were intently fixed at me. She made
an attempt to break away from the fastening, and
then began trembling in all her limbs. At these
symptoms of fright I again turned round, and perceived
behind me, about fifteen paces off, the lion
stretched out at the foot of a juniper-tree, through
the branches of which he was surveying us and
making wry faces. In the position I was in, it
was impossible for me to fire without facing about.
I tried to fire from the left shoulder but felt awkward.
In turning gently round without rising,
I was in a favorable position, and just as I was
levelling my piece the lion stood up and began to
show me all his teeth, at the same time shaking
his head, as much as to say, 'What the devil are
you doing there?' I did not hesitate a moment,
and fired at his mouth. The animal fell on the
spot as if struck by lightning. My men ran up
at the shot; and as they were eager to lay hands
on the lion, I fired a second time between the
eyes, in order to secure his lying perfectly still.
The first bullet had taken the course of the spine
throughout its entire length, passing through the
marrow, and had come out at the tail. I had never
before fired a shot that penetrated so deeply, and
yet I had only loaded with sixty grains. It is true
the rifle was one of Devisme's and the bullets steel-pointed.
The lion, a black one and among the
oldest I have ever shot, supplied the kettles of
four companies of infantry who were stationed at
Klenchela. Receive, my dear L&eacute;on, the assurance
of my devoted affection.</p></div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jules Gerard."</span></p>

<p>The exploit of 1850 was the chasing of
two lions, one of which he killed; the other,
supposed to be the one now shot, running
away from him and escaping, after a vigorous
chase of many miles. Some one&mdash;a celebrated
author, indeed, with whose astonishing
adventures we have been familiar from
boyhood&mdash;envious of the recent fame of Mr.
Arthur Gordon Cumming and M. Jules Gerard,
has sent the following letter to the editor
of the London <i>Times</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir,&mdash;The exploit of M. Jules Gerard, recorded
in <i>The Times</i> of the 14th inst., is certainly very
wonderful, but by no means equals one performed
by myself in South Africa. Observing on one
occasion a large black lion, about 18 feet in length,
reposing under a caoutchouc tree, I fired, and the
bullet, like that of M. Gerard, went right through
the backbone and came out at the tail; but, wonderful
to relate, it hit against the tree, and rebounding,
came back the same way and went
straight into the barrel of my rifle, just after I
had reloaded with powder. I instantly presented
my piece at the lioness, which was reposing by
the side of her lord, and fired; and thus I killed
two animals (so large that they supplied three regiments
of the line and 200 irregular cavalry with
food for nearly a week) with one and the same
bullet. In case any of your readers should doubt
the truth of this statement, I eschew the usual
fashion of writing under a false name, and subscribe
myself, your very obedient servant,</p></div>

<div class="caption"><h2>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.</h2></div>
</div>


<p>We present to the readers of the <i>International
Magazine</i>, this month, from a
recent Daguerrotype by Brady, the best portrait
ever published of the greatest living poet
who writes the English language.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Cullen Bryant</span> was born on the
third of November, 1794, in the village of Cummington,
Massachusetts. His father, Dr. Peter
Bryant of that place, one of the most eminent
physicians of the day, was possessed of
extensive literary and scientific acquirements,
an unusually vigorous and well-disciplined
mind, and an elegant and refined taste. He
was fond of study, and sought to infuse into
the minds of his young and growing family,
those habits of intellectual exertion which
had been to himself a source of so much exalted
pleasure. It was fortunate for the subject
of this notice, that such was his character;
for when his own genius began to discover
signs of its power, he found in his father
an able and skilful instructor, who chastened,
improved, and encouraged the first
rude efforts of his boyhood. That parent did
not, like the father of Petrarch, burn the poetic
library of his son, amid the tears and
groans of the boy; nor, like the relatives of
Alfieri, suppress, for nearly one-third of his
existence, the poetic fervor which consumed
his heart; but, looking upon poetry as a high,
perhaps the highest of arts, and poetic eminence
as the noblest fame, he nourished with
cheerful care the least indications of its presence,
and supplied the youth with the means
of its culture and growth. Nor were his services
unrewarded, as it appears from Mr.
Bryant's solemn Hymn to Death, by the subsequent
gratitude and success of his pupil.</p>

<p>When only ten years of age, Mr. Bryant
produced several small poems, which, though
of course marked by the defects and puerilities
of so immature an age, were yet thought
to possess sufficient merit to be published in
the newspaper of a neighboring village&mdash;the
Hampshire Gazette. His friends, though
pleased with these early evidences of talent,
did not injure him with injudicious flattery,
but, in the spirit of Dryden's simile, treated
them</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As those who unripe veins in mines explore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the rich bed again the warm turf lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till time digests the yet imperfect ore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Knowing it would be gold another day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Bryant acquired the rudiments of his
school education under the care, first of the
Rev. Mr. Snell of Brookfield, and then under
that of the Rev. Mr. Hallock of Plainfield,
Massachusetts. They found in him a sprightly
and intelligent pupil, better pleased to lay up
knowledge from books, and the silent meditation
of nature, than to join in the ordinary
pastimes of children. He was quick of apprehension,
and diligent in pursuit. He rapidly
ran through the usual preliminary studies;
and in 1810, then in the sixteenth year
of his age, was entered a member of the
sophomore class of Williams' College. In that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
institution, he continued his studies with the
same ardor and enthusiasm. He was particularly
noted for his fondness for the classics,
and in a little while made himself master of
the more interesting portions of the literature
of Greece and Rome. But he had not been
in college more than a year or two, when he
asked and procured an honorable dismission,
for the purpose of devoting himself to the
study of the law. This he did in the office
of Judge Howe of Worthington, and afterwards
in that of the Hon. William Baylies of
Bridgewater, and, in 1815, was admitted to
practice at the bar of Plymouth.</p>

<p>But, during the period of his studies, Mr.
Bryant had not neglected the cultivation of
his poetic abilities. In 1808, before he went
to college, he had published, in Boston, a satirical
poem, which attracted so much attention,
that a second edition was demanded in
the course of the next year. "When it is remembered,"
observes Mr. Leggett, "that this
work was given to the public by an author
who had not completed his fourteenth year, it
cannot but be considered a remarkable instance
of early maturity of mind. Pope's
Ode to Solitude was written at twelve years
of age; but it possesses neither fancy nor
feeling, and except for the harmony of its
versification, is entitled to no particular praise.
His Translation of Sappho to Phaon is indeed
an extraordinary production, and has uniformly
received the warmest commendation from
the critics. Yet, it is but a translation, while
the poem of our author, written still earlier
in life, is an original effort, and as such cannot
but be received with greater surprise, on
account of the wonderful precocity of judgment,
wit, and fancy it exhibits. Like Cowley's
Poetical Blossoms, it must have been
composed when the writer was little more
than thirteen; but in point of merit, it is decidedly
superior to these effusions of unripened
genius." Certain political strictures on Mr.
Jefferson and his party, which this poem contained,
have given rise, since Mr. Bryant has
become conspicuous as an ardent friend of
democracy, to charges of political inconsistency
and faithlessness. They are charges,
however, that require no refutation; and we
refer to them now only to remark, that it is
a singular evidence of Mr. Bryant's integrity
and discernment, that the only point of attack
which embittered enemies have found in
his whole life, are his unconsidered mutterings
when a stripling of only thirteen, living in
times of high political excitement, and among
a people who were all of one way of thinking.
How few pass through life with characters
so pure and unassailable!</p>

<p>But what chiefly contributed to give Mr.
Bryant rank as a poet, was the publication,
in the North American Review of 1816, of
the poem of Thanatopsis, written four years
before, in 1812. That a young man, not yet
nineteen, should have produced a poem so
lofty in conception, and so beautiful in execution,
so full of chaste language, and delicate
and striking imagery&mdash;and above all, so pervaded
by a noble and cheerful religious philosophy&mdash;may
well be regarded as one of the
most wonderful events of literary history.
And the wonder is increased when we learn,
that this sublime lyric was followed, in the
course of the few next years, by the "Inscription
for an Entrance into a Wood," written
in 1813, and published in the North American
in 1817; by the "Waterfowl," written in
in 1816, and published in 1818; and by the
"Fragment of Simonides," written in 1811,
and published in 1818. In 1821, he wrote
his largest poem, "The Ages," which was
delivered before the Phi Beta Kappa Society
of Harvard College, and soon after published
at Boston, in a small volume, in connection
with the poems we have already mentioned,
and some others. The appearance of this
volume at once established the fame of Mr.
Bryant as a poet.</p>

<p>In the same year Mr. Bryant married a
young and amiable lady, Miss Fairchild, of
Great Barrington, Mass., whither he had removed
to prosecute his profession. He was
both skilful and successful as a lawyer, but
the labor of the vocation clashing with his
poetic and moral sensibilities, induced him,
after a ten years' practice, to remove, in 1825,
to the city of New-York, to commence a career
of literary effort. His fame, which had
preceded him, soon procured him the editorship
of the New-York Review, which he
managed, in connection with other gentlemen,
with great industry and talent. About the
same time he joined Mr. Gulian C. Verplanck,
Mr. Robert Sands, and Fitz-Greene Halleck,
and several young artists of the city, in the
production of an Annual called "The Talisman,"
which for beauty and variety of contents,
has not been surpassed, even in these
more prolific days of Annuals. Some of
Mr. Bryant's contributions to it place him
as a prose writer beside the best of any nation.
The narrative of the "Whirlwind,"
for accurate description, condensed energy
and eloquence of expression, and touching
incident, has always struck us as one of the
master-pieces of writing.</p>

<p>In 1827, Mr. Bryant became an editor of
the New-York Evening Post, and since then,
with the exception of the years 1834 and '49,
when he travelled with his family in Europe,
has had the almost exclusive control of that
journal. It is by his conduct in this capacity,
that he has acquired his standing as a
politician.</p>

<p>We have cause, then, to speak of Mr. Bryant's
political character. When he first undertook
the management of the Evening Post,
that paper had taken no decided stand in the
politics of the day. Its leanings, however,
were towards the aristocratic party. Mr. Bryant
soon infused into its columns some portion
of his native originality and spirit. Its
politics assumed a higher tone, its disquisitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
on public measures became daily more
pointed and stirring, and, finally, it declared
with great boldness on what was considered
the more liberal side. From that day to this,
it has taken a leading part in political controversies,
and exerted a controlling influence
over public opinion. In the fierce excitement
kindled by General Jackson's attack upon
the United States Bank, in the hot debates
of the tariff and internal improvement
questions, and in the deeply-agitating, almost
convulsive contest which prostrated the banking
system, the Evening Post maintained the
strongest ground, was generally in advance
of its day, and never faltered or flinched in
the assertion of the severest tenets of the
democratic creed. Unlike most journals, it
did not satisfy itself with an undiscriminating
defence of the temporary doctrines of party,
but, regardless alike of friend and foe, yet
cautiously and calmly, it expressed the whole
truth in its length and breadth.</p>

<p>The manner in which Mr. Bryant has conducted
these controversies is in the highest
degree honorable to him. He has disdained
the miserable arts by which small minds
achieve the triumphs of their party or their
own profit. Drawing his principles from the
independent conclusions of his own mind, he
has not shifted with every wind of doctrine.
He has regarded politics, not as the strife of
opposing interests, nor as a factious struggle
for party supremacy, nor yet as a predatory
warfare for the spoils of success, but as the
solemn conflict of great principles. He has
studied it as a comprehensive science, in which
the rights and happiness of millions of men
are interested, and which has issues and dependencies
spreading over the events of many
years. In this light, he has sought to teach
its truths, with conscientious fidelity.</p>

<p>His intellectual adaptation to his calling is
in many respects a striking one. With a mind
of quick sagacity, strong reasoning powers,
ready wit, and an inexhaustible fertility, he
has been able to perform its incessant and laborious
duties with signal success. Disciplined,
as well as enriched by severe study,
he has added to the learning of books the attainments
of extensive observation and travel.
His style is remarkable for its purity and elegance,
no less than for the felicity of its illustrations.
In controversy, he most frequently
resorts to a caustic but graceful irony. He is
playful without being vulgar, pointed without
grossness, sharp as a Damascus blade, and
just as polished. Nor are the compactness
and strength of his expression less to be admired,
than his uniform perspicuity and ease.
That he is sometimes unnecessarily cutting,
as some complain, is a fault, if it exist, that
springs from the native integrity of his mind,
and the secluded and refined nature of his
pursuits. It has seemed to us, however, that
this alleged severity is no more than the spirit
of justice as it manifests itself in a pure and
honest mind. For we doubt if a man more
perfectly just, and less liable to be warped by
the questionable compliances of society, ever
lived.</p>

<p>We shall not enter into any criticism of Mr.
Bryant's poetry here, because it has been so fully
estimated before, that there is no need of
doing so again; but there is one view which
has been taken of it, on which we shall offer
a few remarks. That view occurs in the following
passage of Mr. J. R. Lowell's Fable for
Critics:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is Bryant, as quiet, as cool, and as dignified,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a smooth, silent iceberg that never is ignified,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save when by reflection 'tis kindled o' nights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a semblance of flame by the chill Northern Lights.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He may rank (Griswold says so) first bard of your nation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(There's no doubt that he stands in supreme ice-olation,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your topmost Parnassus he may set his heel on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no warm applauses come, peal following peal on,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's too smooth and too polished to hang any zeal on:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unqualified merits, I'll grant, if you choose, he has 'em,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he lacks the one merit of kindling enthusiasm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he stir you at all, it is just, on my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like being stirred up with the very North Pole,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"He is very nice reading in summer, but <i>inter</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nos</i>, we don't want <i>extra</i> freezing in winter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take him up in the depth of July, my advice is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you feel an Egyptian devotion to ices.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, deduct all you can, there's enough that's right good in him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has a true soul for field, river, and wood in him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his heart in the midst of brick walls, or where'er it is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glows, softens, and thrills with the tenderest charities&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To you mortals that delve in this trade-ridden planet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, to old Berkshire's hills, with their limestone and granite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you're one who <i>in loco</i> (add <i>foco</i> here) <i>desipis</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will get out of his outermost heart (as I guess) a piece;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you'd get deeper down if you came as a precipice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would break the last seal of its inwardest fountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you could only palm yourself off for a mountain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mr. Quivis, or somebody quite as discerning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some scholar who's hourly expecting his learning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls B. the American Wordsworth; but Wordsworth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is worth near as much as your whole tuneful herd's worth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, don't be absurd, he's an excellent Bryant;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, my friends, you'll endanger the life of your client,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By attempting to stretch him up into a giant:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you choose to compare him, I think there are two persons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">fit for a parallel&mdash;Thomson and Cowper;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don't mean exactly,&mdash;there's something of each,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's T.'s love of nature, C.'s penchant to preach;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just mix up their minds so that C.'s spice of craziness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall balance and neutralize T.'s turn for laziness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it gives you a brain cool, quite frictionless, quiet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose internal police nips the buds of all riot,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brain like a permanent strait-jacket put on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart which strives vainly to burst off a button,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brain which, without being slow or mechanic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does more than a larger less drilled, more volcanic;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's a Cowper condensed, with no craziness bitten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the advantage that Wordsworth before him has written.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, what is the main charge here: that Mr.
Bryant, while he has great sympathy with external
nature, with mountains and precipices,
has no sympathy with his fellow-man. 'Tis
a weighty charge&mdash;the weightiest that can be
made against a man or a poet. It says virtually
that he has no soul, no heart, no impulse,
no feeling, except for brutes and vegetables;
in short, that he is no better than a
heathen savage, a regular worshipper of stocks
and stones, without natural affection, or without
God in the world. "For," as the apostle
queries very wisely, "if he love not man,
whom he hath seen, how can he love God,
whom he hath not seen?" Your lines, then,
Mr. Quiz, imply nothing less than black, bleak,
barren, unredeemed practical Atheism!</p>

<p>But can there be the remotest semblance
of truth in them? Is our Bryant such a heathen
or atheist as not to know his fellow-men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
except they present themselves in the disguise
of mountains, or he see them, like the
prophet, as trees walking? We appeal to
you, young ladies, who have been melted into
tears by his pathos. We appeal to you, young
men, whose every purpose of good has been
quickened into livelier action by his words;
and to you, old heads, whose experience has
learned a riper and mellower wisdom from
his fine meditative views of the ends and
aims of life.</p>

<p>Yet, before you render your concurrent
answers, with somewhat of indignation that
anybody could put you upon the task, let us,
in good American sort, begin with a few statistics.
This is a question of fact, and since
it has been raised, we will determine it by
facts.</p>

<p>There are, in Carey &amp; Hart's splendid
edition of Bryant&mdash;we mean splendid as to the
typography and paper, and not inclusive of
those ill-drawn sketches of Leutze, who has
made the women all German and given
Mr. William Tell of Switzerland a straddle as
wide as the Dardanelles, to say nothing of the
hideous face of Rizpah and that Monk so
excessively huge as to stand some forty feet
from the pillar against which he leans&mdash;this
splendid edition, we say, contains just one
hundred and thirty-two poems, all told, to
which,&mdash;stand up and listen, to the sentence,
Mr. Lowell!&mdash;more than seventy refer
wholly to subjects of an exclusively human
interest&mdash;man in his being and doing, while
nine out of ten of the rest, though occupied
primarily with some phase of external nature,
are yet so managed as to weave a deep and
beautiful human philosophy,&mdash;with the dull
and dead proceedings of the mechanical
world. Yes, Mr. Critic, we say that there is
a very fine, a very rich, a very noble and
very touching vein of human sentiment,
which runs through all of Bryant's writings,
whereby, even as much as Wordsworth,
he makes these mountains and precipices a
part of our human life, and whereby, too, he
makes the whole of us, who read him lovingly,
that is, who read him at all, much better
men and women, in our several spheres. No
human sympathies forsooth! Why there are
hundreds, nay, thousands, of us, who have
derived many of their tenderest and noblest
humanities from this very cold-blooded He-Daphne;
this fleshless marble Apollo,&mdash;this
Ice-Palace and Alpine glacier,&mdash;far shining
brilliant, but oh how frigid!</p>

<p>By poems of an exclusive human interest,
we mean, such as bear directly on man's
experience and duties and relations in this life:
such as the Ages, for instance, which commemorates
the progress of humanity, through all
its trials and triumphs: such as Thanatopsis,
which makes the grave glorious, and pours
the light of a lofty and serene religion around
our darkest hour: such as the Old Man's
Funeral, more divine in its descriptive beauty
than the best sermon we ever heard: such as
the Battle Field, which animates us with the
voice of trumpet to meet the stern struggles
of daily warfare: and such as many others in
the same vein, to say nothing of the Murdered
Traveller, the Massacre at Scio, the Hunter
of the Prairies, the Living Lost, the Crowded
Street, the Greek Boy, the Arctic Lover, the
African Chief, the Child's Funeral, &amp;c., &amp;c.
These could only have been prompted by a
strong feeling of sympathy with man, and
though executed with the nicest finish of art,
are yet full of touching pathos and sentiment.
The best proof of this is, that they
invariably excite the emotions they were intended
to excite&mdash;and that, too, in no milk
and waterish way. They sink straight into
the heart; they open the fountains of the feelings;
they send the salt water to the eyes
(if that be needed); they make the blood
tingle; in short, they produce that all-overishness
which comes upon one when he sees
a fine action on the stage, or reads a noble
passage in an oration, or looks at Lentze's
Washington. Try it on yourself, if you don't
believe it, or, what is better, try it on your
little girl and boy, whose feelings are not yet
case-hardened or frozen over! It will be a
queer kind of frigidity that they will be witness
to. Why, bless your soul, Mr. Lowell,
we are free to confess that we have ourselves
long, long ago, cried over the Indian Girl's
Lament, and the Death of the Flowers,&mdash;yes,
cried, and we say it without shame,&mdash;indeed,
with a strange sense of regret that we cannot
cry now over things of that sort. <i>Eheu, eheu
fugaces</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>More than that, we have asseverated that
even in poems which are not immediately
emotional, which are directed to some phase
of mere external nature, the humanitary tendencies
of Bryant break out, or shine through
as veins of silver from the rocks. It is, in
fact, one of his most charming peculiarities,
that he habitually connects great moral and
social truths with the various aspects of nature.
His muse is never satisfied with celebrating
the pomp and glory of the external
world; she must find a deeper meaning in all
than what the eye sees or the ear hears; she
must trace some beautiful analogy, some spiritual
significance on which both mind and
heart can repose. Bryant's descriptions of
nature, it is granted, are accurate to a line;
what he speaks he knows; he finds no nightingales
nor cowslips just three thousand miles
away from where it is possible for them to
live; and he never writes from his memory
of books; yet his descriptions are more than
mere descriptions,&mdash;dull scientific catalogues
of quantities,&mdash;herbariums of dried plants,&mdash;museums
of withered lifeless twigs, and of
stuffed animals standing thereupon! They
have all a meaning under them&mdash;a hidden
wisdom&mdash;a genial yet profound human soul.
It is thus that he has wound our affections
around the North Star, the Winds, Monument
Mountain, and even the Ruffled Grouse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
How often, too, in the midst of his general
meditations and philosophizings, does some
touching individual allusion creep in, to show
that the poet's heart is all alive with sensibility:
as in the Hymn to Death, which closes
with that solemn monody on the Departure
of his Father:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Alas! I little thought that the stern Power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose fearful praise I sung, would try me thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the strain was ended. It must cease.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he is in his grave, who taught my youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The art of verse, and in the bud of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offered me to the Muses. Oh, cut off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untimely! when the reason in its strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ripened by years of toil and studious search,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watch of Nature's silent lessons, taught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hand to practice best the lenient art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which thou gavest thy laborious days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And last, thy life. And, therefore, when the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received thee, tears were in unyielding eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on hard cheeks, and they who deemed thy skill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delayed their death hour, shuddered and turned pale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou wert gone. This faltering verse which thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt not, as wont, o'erlook, is all I have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To offer at thy grave,&mdash;this&mdash;and the hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To copy thy example, and to leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A name of which the wretched shall not think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of an enemy's, whom they forgive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all forgive the dead. Rest, therefore, thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose early guidance trained my infant steps&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rest, on the bosom of God, till the brief sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Death is over&mdash;and a happier life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall dawn to waken thine insensible dust!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Does an iceberg write in that strain, we
should like to know? Or does it mourn the
death of the flowers, in this wise:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And then I think of one, who in her youthful beauty died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the cold moist earth we laid her, when the forest cast the leaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not unmeet it was that one like that young friend of ours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or do icebergs yearn thus for communion in
the after world with the beloved spirits of this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In meadows fanned by Heaven's life-breathing wind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the resplendence of that glorious sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And larger movements of the unfettered mind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wilt thou forget the love that joined us here?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The love that lived through all the stormy past,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And meekly with my harsher nature bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deeper grew and tenderer to the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall it expire with life and be no more?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Truly, that iceberg theory must be surrendered,
it must melt and give way before the gentle
warmth of these words, and the thousand
other such words which any reader of Bryant
will instantly recall.</p>

<p>But, having convinced and confuted Mr.
Critic, we will proceed to observe that there
is after all a foundation of truth&mdash;a slender
one&mdash;for his towering superstructure of ridicule.
It is this: that in the outset of
his career, Mr. Bryant's sympathies were,
not too much with external Nature, but too
little with Man. At the same time, we
maintain that he has been constantly correcting
this fault, and has written more and
more, the older he has grown, to the human
heart. He is not, and we hope never will
be, a passionate writer, like Byron: he is not
one who deals, like Burns, with the warm,
gushing, homely affections of the poor every
where: he has none of Schiller's energy of
conviction: none of the naive, playful garrulous
bonhomie of Beranger; simply, because
he is of another order of man from all
these. He is quiet, gentle, contemplative,
modest,&mdash;wise. Yet if no lava-tides of passion
burn through his veins, as were said to
run through the veins of Alfieri; if he is not,
as Carlyle said of Dante, "a red-hot cone of
fire" shooting steadily up into the sky; if he
cannot, with Shakespeare, or Goethe, make the
blood quiver and thrill for weeks by a single
word; he is still not a frigid, heartless writer,
not altogether an ice mountain, which dazzles
always but never warms. He is too earnest,
too truthful, too good for that; too deeply
penetrated by the spiritual realities of life,
too democratic in his aspirations for our race,
too hopeful of the future developments of
society, in short, too finely touched with that
feminine element which is the characteristic
of genius. Besides, the great internal fires of
the Earth, which shoot up in terrific and explosive
violence, stupendous as they are, do
not nurse the tender bud into life, nor cover
the earth with verdure and fruit. This is
left to the genial sunshine and the warm summer
rains.</p>

<p>In private intercourse, Mr. Bryant is what
all his writings, poetical as well as prose, indicate.
His life is that of a student of elegant
and lofty literature. He is reserved in his
manner, almost to repulsiveness, yet in the
social circle is witty, amiable, and affectionate.
When his sympathies are interested, the
spirit of tenderness and benevolence gleams
like a flame from his eyes, and plays around
his features in a beautiful radiance. In his
opinions of men, he endeavors to be just; but
when he is not just, the leaning is towards
the side of mercy. A strong natural irritability
has been disciplined by stern effort into
the subjection of reason; and his tastes and
habits, though refined by careful culture, are as
simple as those of a child. Those who know
him best are at a loss which most to admire,
the superiority of his faculties, or the modesty
of his deportment.</p>

<p>The London <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, after an observation
that a hurriedly written epitaph
always appears, in the course of time, to require
revisal, expresses its admiration for the
good sense of a Parisian sculptor, who, when
he took his instructions for a monument, insisted
upon the <i>veuve inconsolable</i> or the heartstricken
husband penning the intended inscription,
and even signing the holograph, as
a further authority to him for immortalizing
so much utter despair. "The day before the
record was actually to be cut for eternity, his
habit was to send the inscription book to the
mourner's house, lest any correction should
be desired. The havoc which, upon receiving
back the volume, he usually found made
among laudatory adjectives and adverbs of
infinity, was, to a good man, a delightful evidence
of the cooling and healing powers of

<h2><a name="A_GERMAN_HAND-BOOK_OF_AMERICA" id="A_GERMAN_HAND-BOOK_OF_AMERICA">A GERMAN HAND-BOOK OF AMERICA.</a></h2>


<p>We have at present in our hands several
recently published European works relative
to America, all of which possess more
than ordinary claims to attention. We have,
however, chosen the most unpretending as
the subject of our present remarks, since, for
the thinking majority of our readers, it will
undoubtedly prove the most interesting. The
volume to which we allude is entitled, <i>Des
Auswanderers' Handbuch</i>, or, <i>The Emigrants'
Hand-book: a True Sketch of the United
States of North America, and Reliable Counsellor
for Men of every Rank and Condition
who propose Emigrating Thither: by</i> <span class="smcap">George
M. von Ross</span>, of North America, Editor of
the "<i>Allgemeinen Auswanderungs-Zeitung</i>"
(Universal Emigration Journal). Published
at Elberfeld and Iserlohn, by Julius Baedeker.</p>

<p>The author, according to his preface, is an
American by birth, and was for many years
a farmer in the eastern, western, and southwestern
sections of the United States. That
he is not without learning and ability is
evinced by his remarkably excellent work
entitled <i>Taschen-Fremdw&ouml;rterbuch, oder Verdeutschung
von mehr als 16,000 Fremdw&ouml;rter</i>&mdash;(<i>i. e.</i>
a Pocket Dictionary of Foreign Words,
or the adoption into German of more than Sixteen
Thousand Foreign Words). This book
is familiar in Germany, and exhibits great
philological acumen, as well as a thorough
knowledge of German in its minutest difficulties.
At one time Mr. Ross distinguished
himself by attacking Schr&ouml;ter's well-known
pamphlet relative to the Catholic emigration
to St. Mary's, in Pennsylvania, and he has
since published a smaller work for emigrants,
entitled <i>Rathschlage und Warnungen</i>, or,
Counsels and Warning.</p>

<p>The performance now before us is written
in that straightforward practical style which
may be best characterized by the statement
that "He had something to say, <i>and
he said it</i>." That it is impartial is not
its least merit. A foreigner, it is true, may
occasionally be found who passes unprejudiced
judgments on another country, but that
any one still retaining home-born sympathies
and feelings with his native land should do
so is a wonder. And we deem it a creditable
thing in this work, that where he is called
upon to describe any calling, trade, or profession,
he is not afraid to say boldly&mdash;In this
calling the German cannot succeed&mdash;in that,
he is unapt&mdash;in a third, the American surpasses
him; while, on the other hand, he
amply encourages the emigrant as regards
occupations for which he is qualified. Many
writers of such books have cast a <i>couleur de
rose</i> light over every thing (well knowing that
by such means their books would be more
saleable), and induced industrious men, following
callings unheard of in this country, to
emigrate, in the absurd hope of finding more
constant and better paid employment here
than at home. An intelligent American, who
would not cross the Atlantic, or hardly
ascend in a balloon, without previously <i>calculating</i>
the time and chances of arrival or
descent, and who certainly would do neither
without first informing himself as to every
imaginable particular of his ultimate destination,
can hardly conceive the vast necessity
of such books. He would, by every means,
gather information from those who had visited
in person the destined land. Not so
the common German emigrant. Thousands
embark in the belief that New-York is some
mysterious golden-glowing Indian city, surrounded
by orange groves and palm-trees.
In the village of Weinsberg, in Suabia, several
years since, a well-educated student was
overheard to remark of some peasants, "Tell
them that in your country the people have
two heads, and they'll believe you."</p>

<p>Let us now, by extracts, give our readers
an idea of the manner in which Mr. Von
Ross describes the land of his birth to the
land of his adoption. The first item of interest
is his sketches of the respective characteristics
of the Yankee and Southerner.</p>

<p>"Superficial observers have spoken of the
inhabitant of the Northern States as if money
were his only aim&mdash;as if he were inspired
only by selfishness and avarice&mdash;and as if
he estimated men by the weight of their
purses. But those who regard him closely,
and judge otherwise than by first appearances,
will discover in him a calculating (<i>berechnenden</i>),
enterprising, thoroughly practical man,
caring little for pleasure, and seeking his recreation
(<i>erholung</i>) in the domestic circle.
They will find in him a man who, with iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
industry, fights his way through life, esteeming
wealth, it is true&mdash;not the inherited,
however, but <i>the earned</i>, which testifies to
the ability of its possessor. A man, in fine,
who with unbending courage bears the blow
of destiny, and is thereby only stimulated to
new exertions. The Southerner, on the contrary,
is more <i>chivalresque</i>&mdash;he lives to live.
The climate in which he is born has also a
material influence upon his manners, customs,
and character: effecting, in reality, the same
difference which we observe between the
cool, reflective, tough North German, and
the jovial, genial, easily excited South German,
or Frenchman. We would hardly have
deemed it necessary to inform the reader that
in <i>thus</i> sketching the inhabitants of the United
States in light outlines, we do not include
the mixed and Europeanized population
of the Atlantic cities, had we not learned by
experience that many travellers slightly acquainted
only with the Atlantic States and
their vicinity, have from these sketched all
North America and its people. He who
would know the American, must also know
the cities of the interior.</p>

<p>"If, in addition to these characteristics, we
should describe the personal and distinctive
appearance of the Northerner and Southerner,
we would say that the first are, generally
speaking, large, tall, and spare&mdash;their ladies
beautiful and of delicate complexion; while
the Southerners are broad-shouldered and
powerful&mdash;the female sex being voluptuously
formed and beautiful, but when not subject
to the influence of exercise and fresh air of a
sallow complexion.</p>

<p>"Every North American is&mdash;and who has
a better right so to <i>be</i>&mdash;an enthusiastic <i>honorer
(vereher) of his fatherland</i>, but he does not
measure out by inches the limits of his native
land, or bound his patriotism by the clod on
which his cradle rested&mdash;for to him the roar
of the Rio del Norte, the thunder-peal of
Niagara, and the murmur of the Pacific or
Atlantic oceans have equally a familiar, home-like
sound. Nor less than the land of his
birth does he esteem its laws, constitution,
and institutions, and regards them in nowise
as oppressive, but as protective. Those laws
he made for himself, and chose himself as
their executor. <span class="smcap">Respect for the Law</span> is to
the American self-respect.</p>

<p>"The so often blamed <i>national pride</i> of the
American, if not really praiseworthy, is at
least pardonable; for a nation which could
rise like a single man, and, at every sacrifice,
throw off the yoke of England&mdash;a nation
which has given birth to such men as <span class="smcap">George
Washington</span>, <span class="smcap">Thomas Jefferson</span>, <span class="smcap">Benjamin
Franklin</span>, and many others whose names are
mentioned with wonder all over this world&mdash;a
nation which occupies the first rank in
trade, commerce, and industry, <i>may</i> be proud,
and <i>must</i> be proud, as long as its power is
free from sloth and lethargy."</p>

<p>And here we may be permitted to interrupt
for an instant our noble Man of Ross
(the reader will observe that he wears the
aristocratic <i>von</i>), for the sake of saying a good
word over this honest, hard-fisted go-ahead
eulogium of our country. There be those
ultra-Europeanized, or <i>soi-disant</i> refinedly
educated Americans, who will complacently
smile at this recapitulation of United States
excellencies, and if slangily inclined, brand
it as "pea-nut," "stump eloquence," and
"Fourth-of-Julyism." The sum-total being,
that it is vulgar rhodomontade. With all
due respect, we think differently. Let the
reader remember that this is addressed to
a German&mdash;a <i>foreign</i>&mdash;audience, who are
greatly in need just at present of a few scraps
of such oratory as this, were it only to counteract
the malignant influences of the English
tourists, whose works are far more extensively
read in Germany than we imagine.
Mrs. Trollope's work on America, which, at
the present day, is regarded only with contempt
or laughter by the educated in England,
has been, and is even yet, read with a
feeling akin to wonder by the honest simple-hearted
Germans. A wonder indeed so intense,
at the marvellous marvels therein narrated,
that it generally results in inspiring in
the mind of the reader credulous enough to
believe, an intense desire to visit the land of
liberty.</p>

<p>"In no part of the world are ladies treated
with so much respect as in North America.
They can make, by land or water, the longest
journeys without the apprehension of
having their sense of delicacy offended by
hearing an improper expression, and, as far
as <i>public</i> opinion is concerned, the law allows
them privileges greater than they obtain in
any other country. By marriage, the wife
enters at once into equal possession of her
husband's property; the simple testimony of
a woman is of the same force as the oath of
a man, and the testimony of a woman when
confirmed by oath, can only be neutralized
by the oaths of three men. The ill-treatment
of a wife by her husband is severely
punished; but such cases are as unusual of
occurrence as that a woman takes undue advantage
of her rights. It may moreover be
confidently asserted, that America is the true
home of connubial love. The consciousness
of her rights gives the American lady a dignity
of manner which admirably blends with
the amiable attractions of her sex. Not a
little of the fascination so peculiar to the ladies
of North America is, however, due to
the circumstance that no woman&mdash;not even
the poorest&mdash;is ever obliged to perform any
task based upon merely physical strength.
She rules at <i>home</i> undisputed; and this is the
reason why the poorest house in America is
a model of neatness and order."</p>

<p>"'<i>Help yourself</i>' (aid yourself), is a favorite
phrase of the American, and which has
given him the character of wanting in charity,
while in fact it is nothing but a simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
indication of the means by which every man
in sound health can in that country relieve
his poverty. <i>Work</i> in America is neither
difficult to obtain, nor is it hemmed in and
oppressed by the regulations and requirements
of <i>guilds</i>, unions, and peculiar laws.
<i>Beggars</i> and <i>vagabonds</i> find indeed no favor
in his eyes; but unfortunate guiltless poverty
invariably meets with his warmest aid, as is
evidenced by the numerous hospitals, institutions,
&amp;c., which would astonish any one reflecting
on the youth of the country. Kindness
and hospitality may also be included
among his virtues.</p>

<p>"From which the reader may justly infer,
that beggary and theft are rare in the United
States; and though it may be alleged that
such occurrences are frequent in the large
cities, it may be at the same time remembered
that these are the <i>rendezvous</i> of the scum
of all nations, while on the other hand the
fact, that in the country, and even in the villages,
locks are rare on house and stable
doors, affords the strongest confirmation that
America presents by far fewer instances of
robbery than the greater part of Europe."</p>

<p>After which, Herr Von Ross indulges in a
few attractive remarks on the facility of marriage
in America, which would, however,
prove far less astonishing to our American,
than to his German readers: concluding with
the following paragraph, which is not devoid
of a certain degree of observation:</p>

<p>"Young married couples whose means will
not permit them to keep house, pass their
first year of wedded life in boarding-houses,
by which means the facilities to marriage are
greatly extended."</p>

<p>The following passages on our alleged
want of sociability identify us to a certain
degree, and to our minds not unpleasantly,
with our English cousins. Of all persons,
those to be most pitied or despised are "the
weak brethren," who, devoid of internal or
intellectual resources, or manly self-reliance,
declaim against a nation or a society at large
because its members, forsooth, do not receive
them with open arms. The true <i>citoyen du
monde</i>&mdash;the genuine cosmopolite, never has
occasion to make this complaint against any
country. For the more a man depends on
himself and the less on others for happiness,
just in that proportion will it be his luck to
attract sympathy and sociability when among
strangers. Narrow-minded Spaniards, and
those of other nations, <i>who travel for the express
purpose of getting into fashionable society</i>,
are peculiarly liable to this reproach.
Such a foreigner have we heard, minutely
and boringly detailing to a stern circle of impregnable
natives, the noble and munificent
style of hospitality with which <i>they</i> would
be treated, were they visitors in <i>his</i> fatherland:
"In my contree 'spose you come strang&eacute;re
in one cittee, a gentleman take you in
hees house. In ze morning come one buttiful
gairl wiz coffees. Zen dey send you one
horse carriage for make de promen&agrave;de. Aftair
dinner come buttiful gairls again wiz ticket
on silvare waiter for whole opera box!
Wat you sink of dat, hey?" "<i>Think!</i>" replied
a native, "why I think that you take
great pains to make a strange gentleman feel
<i>very uncomfortable</i>." But to return to our
writer.</p>

<p>"Strangers who have hastily travelled and
superficially examined America, and those
who have judged by the statements of others
rather than by their own experience, have
ascribed to the American a want of sociability
and a stiff and repulsive manner towards
strangers. True it is that in America it is no
very easy matter to become intimate with a
man or establish one's self in his family circle&mdash;but
he who has once attained this point,
becomes a home friend in the fullest sense of
the word, and will find hidden beneath the
stern, earnest exterior of the American, a
warm heart, and in his conversation a remarkable
degree of familiar confidence. Those
who have detected in the confident manner
and sense of independence which the American
manifests, any thing approaching to presumption,
must assuredly have been the newly
arrived, who could not accustom themselves
to the idea that even laborers should
consider that they had with others equal
right to express their opinions. The man,
however, who is free from prejudice will not
fail to admire a nation, wherein the poorest
is on an equality with the richest, and where
the rich, at least, do not take it on themselves
to assert their superiority. Seldom, indeed,
do we find a native American, conscious of
his right to equality, giving a stranger (his
possible superior in intelligence or education)
to understand that he considers himself quite
as good as any one&mdash;the right is to him a
thing so natural, that it never even occurs to
him to boast of it. This is, unfortunately,
far from being the case with the majority of
the more ignorant German emigrants, accustomed
in their own country to oppressive
laws, and not unfrequently hard treatment,
yet without learning the orderly conduct
which these should have taught, and who
think that in America they have a right to
do as they please. The American Germans
seem to entertain the opinion that it is their
republican duty, at all times, with or without
occasion or provocation, to give to every man
belonging in Europe to the higher classes, to
understand and feel that the difference of rank
is not recognized&mdash;as if indeed, in America
far more than in Europe, education and culture
did not of themselves indicate the rank
which a man occupies. These American Germans
all nourish the jealousy of trade (<i>Brodneid</i>)
the miserable little hatreds, and the
whole range of German disunity or local enmities,
which they brought over with them,
with a care and zeal worthy of a better cause.
Seldom indeed do we hear a German there
call himself German, he remains as of old a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
Prussian, a Bavarian, a Hanoverian, a Hessian,
or an Altenburger. Even the irritation
between North and South Germans still continues,
but let one of them only get together
so many scraps of English as will barely render
him intelligible, <i>then</i> he denies his fatherland&mdash;Americanizes
both Christian and surnames&mdash;adopts
tobacco chewing, and other
evil customs of the New World, and draws
on himself with full justice the contempt of
his more sensible fellow-countrymen and the
ridicule of the Americans. Let no one misunderstand
us, we pronounce this hard judgment
not against the entire German population
of North America, but still a great&mdash;a
very great portion thereof are with the fullest
justice obnoxious to these charges, and he
who has lived any time in the German districts
of North America, and more particularly
among the German, or German descended
population of Pennsylvania, will agree with
us with all his heart."</p>

<p>These are not amiable words, even if merited,
but we must still admire the energy with
which the blow is given. Often have we despised
the contemptible and weak spirit which
could induce so many almost newly arrived
Germans to change fine sounding and easily
enunciable names, into vulgar, snobbish appellatives
for which no child would thank
them. Often have we wondered at the
pitiable impertinence with which ignorant
Deutschers have taken it upon themselves, in
the second rate American-German journals
to abuse our national observance of the Sabbath,
or our respect for women, and despised
the small-minded eagerness with which they
caught up any petty disrespect toward females,
and cited it complacently as a proof
that this noble attribute was on the wane in
<i>the land of their adoption</i>. Often have we
been amazed at the readiness with which illiterate
rascals, whose ideas of government or
political liberty, were at home bounded by the
word: "<i>Polizei</i>," "<i>Strafe</i>," "<i>Wanderbuch</i>,"
"<i>Zuchthaus</i>," and "<i>Fechten</i>" take it upon
themselves to curse, ban and vilify the only
land in the world where they could find
bread or protection. But again, with Mr.
Ross, we earnestly protest that we do <i>not</i> believe
that such conduct or such foolish ingratitude
can ever with justice be attributed to
any respectable or well educated Germans.
Some few there have been, indeed, who, urged
by the selfish stimulant of a desire for popularity,
have thus flattered the prejudices of
their more ignorant fellow-countrymen, but
none who have thus spoken from the heart.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we may remark that if, as
has generally been said, we are a sensitive
race, attaching undue importance to the good
opinion of our neighbors, and striving infinitely
more than we need to keep up a good national
reputation, we ought to be much obliged
to all who, like Mr. Ross, preach to other
countries in their own tongue and with such
a peculiarly distinct enunciation, their candid
and unbiased opinion of their native land.
What must strike the reader is indeed the remarkably
unembarrassed and independent air
with which he addresses his audience, and
the coolness with which, on their own ground,
he points out their own defects, and their general
inferiority to the freemen of "this great
and glorious country." He tells them that
America is a land of hard work&mdash;a church-going,
Sabbath-keeping, God-fearing, moral
land, for which they must prepare themselves;
and no Methodist ever assured his flock of his
solemn conviction that they were all irreclaimable
sinners, with greater earnestness
than Mr. Ross announces to his public, in the
plainest terms, that the great majority of the
German emigrants to America are a pack of
graceless, narrow-minded, ignorant, fatherland-denying
knaves; ending with an earnest
appeal to all whom it may concern, or are
therein informed, to know if they do not with
heart and soul (<i>aus vollum Flerzen</i>) coincide
with him in these views. But the American
reader who for an instant imagines that Mr.
Ross will lose either popularity or reputation
among his auditors, is decidedly mistaken.
Accustomed as we are to regard with nervous
anxiety the slightest opinion of the most
insignificant foreigner regarding our country,
and to raise high very tornadoes of indignation
against such writers as have abused
our own manners and customs, we can
hardly conceive that an author after "<i>giving
it</i>" to his readers in such a remarkably hot-and-heavy
style, and, to make all perfectly
intelligible, concluding with the assurance that
it is from his very heart, can still proceed
quietly, editing a paper, keeping up his list,
and remaining unmobbed.</p>

<p>But we trust that the day is not distant
when foreigners will no longer be able to
taunt us with undue sensitiveness. So rapidly
have we of late years increased in power,
in wealth, in influence, that our conviction
of our own might has not kept pace with its
growth. Like the young giant in Rabelais,
we have lain in our cradle without an attempt
to break the chain. But with the consciousness
of our vast and immovable moral and
political superiority (a consciousness which
despite the good self-opinion so generally attributed
to Americans, has hitherto scarce
dawned on us), will come a quiet disregard of
the united abuse and laughter of all Europe.
A Dickens may <i>then</i> issue his "Notes"&mdash;a
Marryatt, publish his "Diary"&mdash;without attracting
the attention or anger of the American
press from Maine to Mexico.</p>

<p>And why need such works irritate our entire
public <i>now</i>? Nay, we believe the period
of our extravagant sensibility to foreign
opinions must at length be considered as past,
and that hereafter we shall be more in peril
of excess of recklessness and bravado. The
effect of this loss of a national characteristic
we shall not here speculate upon. But a brief
period will be necessary for its illustration.</p>

<p class="center">COMMUNICATED TO THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE</p>

<p class="center">BY JOHN ROMEYN BRODHEAD.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1649, there appeared in Holland
a small anonymous pamphlet of forty-two
pages, bearing the imprint of Antwerp, and
entitled <i>Breeden Raedt, aen de Vereenighde
Nederlandeche Provintien</i>, or Plain Counsels
to the United Netherlands' Provinces. It is
very rare; the only copy I know of, in this
country, is the one with which I have been
kindly furnished by my friend Mr. Campbell,
the Deputy Librarian at the Hague.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The substance of this interesting article was read by
Mr. Brodhead at the last meeting of the Historical Society.&mdash;<i>Ed.
International.</i></p></div>

<p>It purports to be a conversation between
ten Dutch interlocutors, respecting the trade
of the Netherlands West India Company.
The chief speaker, is a Dutch "schipper,"
who had been in New Netherland. In the
course of his remarks, he gives many very interesting
and novel details, concerning the
two directors, Kieft and Stuyvesant, and their
respective administrations. As some of these
particulars have never before been known to
our historians, I propose to translate a few
of the most interesting. It is very evident,
however, that the narrator was not a mere
schipper of a merchant vessel. He was intimately
acquainted with the details of the local
politics of New Netherland; and evidently
was personally unfriendly both to Kieft
and Stuyvesant. From internal evidence,
and for various other reasons, I have been
led to believe that this little work was prepared
by or under the superintendence of
Cornelius Melyn, who had been one of the
foremost and most consistent advocates of
the popular cause under Kieft, and who
suffered gross injustice from the tyrannical
and oppressive conduct of Stuyvesant. The
title-page of the tract states that it was "prepared
and compiled from divers true and veritable
memorials, by 'I. A.,'" who is described
as G.W.O., perhaps Gezaghebber, or Director
of the West India Company. Whoever
these initials, I. A., are meant to represent,
the author seems to have fully adopted the
views and expressed the feelings of Melyn.
While, therefore, some allowance should be
made for occasional exhibitions of personal bitterness,
the statements in the Breeden Raedt
appear to be entitled to full credit, respecting
the facts which they relate. Some of these
are entirely novel; others are confirmatory
of what we have before known; all of them
seem to be entirely harmonious with the story
of New Netherland.</p>

<p>The antecedents of director Kieft, (of whom
we have heretofore known little or nothing
previously to his arrival at Manhattan in
1638), are thus related: "William Kieft was
born at Amsterdam. From youth he was
educated as a merchant; and, after having
taken charge of, or rather neglected, his own
and his master's business, for a certain time,
at Rochelle, he happened to fail there. Upon
which, according to custom, his portrait
was stuck upon the gallows there, as several
living witnesses, who have seen it with
their own eyes, can yet testify. This man,
having been for some time out of business,
was employed to ransom several Christian
prisoners out of Turkey. To such a bankrupt
the money was intrusted. He went
and freed some, for whom there was the least
to pay; but the others, whose friends had
contributed the most money, he left in bondage.
For these, their parents and friends
were once more obliged to raise funds. This
fine brother was appointed by the directors,
to be Director over the inhabitants and trade
of New Netherland in the year 1637."</p>

<p>The events of the Indian war in 1643, are
referred to with a distinctness which leaves
little doubt that the narrator was himself,
one of the witnesses of them. In these respects,
the Breeden Raedt confirms the statements
of De Vries and other authorities in the
Holland documents at Albany. With respect
to the transactions on Long Island in 1644,
and the civil and religious difficulties which
divided the people against director Kieft until
his successor arrived in 1647, the pamphlet
exhibits several interesting and novel details.</p>

<p>Stuyvesant is described as "the son of a
clergyman in Friesland, and who formerly, at
Franiker (the seat of a famous high school,
now extinct), had robbed the daughter of his
own landlady. Being caught in the fact, he
had been let off for his father's sake; otherwise
it would perhaps have been there, that
he must have paid the penalty of his first offence."
On his arrival in New Netherland,
Stuyvesant is described as conducting himself
as arrogantly as the "Grand Duke of Moscovy,"
and as promptly taking the side of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>predecessor Keift, against Melyn and Kuyter,
the leaders of the popular party. In this, the
Breeden Raedt confirms our official accounts.
The two patriots were tried, convicted, and
sentenced to be fined, and transported to
Holland. They were sent as prisoners on
board the ship Princess, in which the late director
Kieft, and Dominie Everardus Bogardus,
the first clergyman in New Netherland
also embarked. The ship struck on the English
coast, "where this ungodly Kieft seeing
death before his eyes, sighing very deeply, dubiously
addressed both these (Kuyter and Melyn):
'Friends, I have done you wrong, can
you forgive me?' The ship being broken into
eight fragments, drove the whole night in the
water. By daybreak, the greater part (of
passengers) were drowned. Cornelius Melyn
lost his son. Dominie Bogardus, Kieft,
Captain John De Vries, and a great number
of people were drowned. There was swallowed
up a great treasure with Kieft, for the
ship was returning with more than four hundred
thousand guilders. Joachim Petersen
Kuyter remained alone on one of the fragments
of the ship, upon which there was a
piece of cannon sticking out of a port, with
which he was saved at daylight. He had
taken it for a man and had spoken to it, but
receiving no answer thought he was dead.
In the end, he was thrown on shore with it,
to the great astonishment of the English,
who came down to the strand by thousands,
and who set up the piece of cannon as a lasting
memorial. Melyn floating on his back in
the sea, fell in with others who were clinging
to a part of the wreck, and was driven on a
sand bank, which became dry with the ebb
tide." From this place they made their escape
to the shore. Kuyter and Melyn, after
saving their lives, became most solicitous to
secure their papers, which were to serve for
their defence in Holland against the sentences
which had been pronounced on them in
New Netherland. After three days' labor,
they fished up a box containing these valued
papers. With these they proceeded to Amsterdam,
and laid their case before the States
General, which granted them an appeal, and
meanwhile suspended Stuyvesant's sentence.</p>

<p>After describing the escape of the "patriots,"
Kuyter and Melyn, and their safe arrival
in Holland with their papers, the Breeden
Raedt continues its review of the Provincial
administration, and gives some particulars
respecting the chief officers and public
affairs in New Netherland, to be found no
where else. The narrative is brought down
to August, 1649, at which time Melyn, who
had returned to New Netherland, seems to
have embarked a second time for Holland, to
bring his case again before the States General.
He appears to have sailed in the same vessel
which conveyed Van der Donck, Couwenhoven,
and Bont, the delegates who had been
commissioned to carry over the "Vertoogh,"
or remonstrance of the commonalty of New
Netherland, against Stuyvesant's arbitrary
government. The Breeden Raedt appears to
have been printed soon after Melyn's return
to the Fatherland. As it contains very severe
reflections upon official persons in the
Province, and as it was an anonymous tract,
it was perhaps judged prudent to publish it
with the imprint of Antwerp. I think, however,
that it was actually printed in Holland.
The Breeden Raedt was one of the earliest,
if not the very earliest separate pamphlet respecting
New Netherland. It was followed
in 1650, by the Vertoogh; in 1651, by Hartger's
description; and in 1655, by Van der
Donck's larger work, and by De Vries's Journal
printed at Alckmaer.</p>

<p>No work has yet appeared this season in
which the better portion of the reading
public have felt so deep an interest as in the
Life of John Sterling, by <span class="smcap">Thomas Carlyle</span>.
But this is less a consequence of the subject
than of the authorship. Any thing from the
hand of Carlyle is sure of a large audience,
but he has hitherto done nothing in which his
personality was likely to be so much involved
as in this life of his friend "<span class="smcap">Arch&aelig;us</span>." We
copy from the London <i>Spectator</i> the following
reviewal of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The domain of political economy is not
unlimited; the laws of supply and demand
are not the only or the strongest forces at
work in nature. Here is a man whom the
world would have been well content to leave
quiet in his early grave by the sea-shore in
the sweetest of English islands; to leave him
there to the soft melodies of the warm wind
and the gentle rain, and the pious visits now
and then of those who knew and loved him
when his eye was bright and his voice eloquent
with sparkling thoughts and warm affections.
He had done nothing that the public
cared for; had left no traces on the sands
of Time that the next tide would not have
effaced. But he lived amongst men who
write books, amongst some of the very best
of such; and two of the foremost of them
loved him so well, that they could not let his
memory die,&mdash;thought that the positive actual
results of his life made known to the
public were but faint indications of the power
that lay in him though sorely foiled and baffled,
and that he in his individual spiritual
progress typified better than most the struggle
that the age is passing through, its processes,
and its results. But the two men,
though united in affection for Sterling, were
so different in other respects, that the memorial
raised by the one could scarcely fail to
be unsatisfactory to the other. Archdeacon
Hare, the author of the earlier biography, is
a man of encyclop&oelig;dic knowledge,&mdash;a profound
classical scholar, the most learned and
philosophical of modern English theologians,
at once accurate and wide in his acquaintance
with European history and literature. And
this large survey of the forms under which
the men of the past have thought and acted,
has not led in him to an indifference to all
forms, but rather to a keener sense of the organic
vitality of forms, especially of national
institutions, whether civil or ecclesiastical polities,
states or churches. Moreover, apart from
this general characteristic, which would lead
to an intellectual and practical reverence for
the institutions of his own land, and a hesitating
caution in the introduction of constitutional
changes, Mr. Hare is an English churchman
of no ordinary cast. He has passed from
the region of traditional belief, has skirted
the bogs and quicksands of doubt and disbelief,
and has found firm footing where alone
it seems possible, in a revelation whose letter
is colored by the human media through which
it has passed, and in a faith whose highest
mysteries are not only harmonious with but
necessary complements to the truths of reason.
The English Church is to him the purest
embodiment of his religious idea, as the
English constitution was to him, in common
with Niebuhr, Coleridge, and other great
thinkers, of the idea of a state. Such a man
could not write a life like Sterling's without
feeling that his relation to Christianity and
the Church was the great fact for him as for
all of us; and that the change in him, from
hearty acceptance of Christian doctrine and
church organization to a rejection of the former
and something very like contempt for
the latter, needed explanation. That explanation
he has sought in the overthrow of the
balance of Sterling's life through repeated attacks
of illness, which shut him out from
practical duties, and threw him entirely upon
speculation, thereby disproportionately developing
the negative side of him, already too
strong from early defects of education: and
few persons will, we should think, be found
to deny Mr. Hare's general position, that the
pursuit of speculative philosophy as the business
of life has this tendency; Mr. Carlyle,
we should have supposed least of all men.
But a special cause interferes with Mr. Carlyle's
recognition of the principle as applicable
to Sterling. Christianity, as understood
commonly perhaps everywhere, except, it
may be, at Weimar and Chelsea, and church
formulas certainly as understood everywhere,
he is in the habit of classing under a category
which in his hands has become an extensive
one&mdash;that of <i>shams</i>. He calls them by various
forcible but ugly names,&mdash;as "old clothes,"
"spectral inanities," "gibbering phantoms,"
or, with plainer meaning, "huge unveracities
and unrealities." That Sterling at any time
of his life accepted these for "eternal verities"
he cannot consider a step from the "no"
to the "yes," nor their repudiation as a step
backwards from the "yes" to the "no." Let
him speak for himself. He is commenting on
Sterling's entry into orders as Mr. Hare's curate
at Hurstmonceaux:</p>

<p>"Concerning this attempt of Sterling's to find
sanctuary in the old Church, and desperately grasp
the hem of her garment in such manner, there
will at present be many opinions; and mine must
be recorded here in flat reproval of it, in mere
pitying condemnation of it, as a rash, false, unwise
and unpermitted step. Nay, among the evil
lessons of his time to poor Sterling, I cannot but
account this the worst; properly indeed, as we
may say, the apotheosis, the solemn apology and
consecration, of all the evil lessons that were in it
to him. Alas! if we did remember the divine and
awful nature of God's Truth, and had not so forgotten
it as poor doomed creatures never did before,&mdash;should
we, durst we in our most audacious
moments, think of wedding it to the world's untruth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>which is also, like all untruths, the devil's?
Only in the world's last lethargy can such things
be done, and accounted safe and pious! Fools!
'Do you think the living God is a buzzard idol,'
sternly asks Milton, 'that you dare address Him in
this manner?' Such darkness, thick sluggish clouds
of cowardice and oblivious baseness, have accumulated
on us; thickening as if towards the eternal sleep!
It is not now known, what never needed proof
or statement before, that Religion is not a doubt;
that it is a certainty,&mdash;or else a mockery and horror.
That none or all of the many things we are
in doubt about, and need to have demonstrated
and rendered probable, can by any alchemy be
made a 'Religion' for us; but are and must continue
a baleful, quiet or unquiet, Hypocrisy for us;
and bring&mdash;<i>salvation</i>, do we fancy? I think it is
another thing they will bring; and are, on all
hands, visibly bringing, this good while!&mdash;--"</p></div>

<p>Herein consists the whole difference between
Hare and Carlyle in their views of
Sterling's career. They looked at it from
such opposite points that what is the zenith
to one is the nadir to the other. What Sterling
himself thought of it, was strikingly expressed
to his brother, Captain Anthony Sterling,
by a comparison, of his case "to that of
a young lady who has tragically lost her lover,
and is willing to be half-hoodwinked into a
convent, or in any noble or quasi-noble way
to escape from a world which has become intolerable."
The truth seems to be, that Sterling
went into orders under the combined influence
of remorse for the share he had inadvertently
had in causing the disastrous fate
of a near relative (Mr. Boyd, who was shot
with Torrijos in Spain), and of a gradual disenchantment
from trust in mere political
schemes for the regeneration of mankind,&mdash;a
disease more common to the genial young
men of his time than of ours. That while in
the exercise of his duties as a parish-priest he
was energetic, useful, and happy, the evidence
in Mr. Hare's book is fully sufficient to
show. It is impossible to say whether his
scepticism would have come upon him had he
continued in that active career; but it is certainly
a gratuitous supposition of Mr. Carlyle
that the ill-health which put an end to it was
only the outward and ostensible cause of its
termination, and does not appear to be borne
out by a single letter or expression of Sterling's
own. Indeed, for years after he left
Hurstmonceaux, he seemed to continue as
firm in his attachment to Christianity as when
he was there; though, on the other hand, it
may well be doubted whether a man of Sterling's
intellect, who would surrender his beliefs
to Strauss's <i>Leben Jesu</i>, is likely in the
present day to keep them under any conceivable
circumstances. We think that Mr. Hare
on the one hand has attributed too exclusive
an influence to Sterling's forced inactivity,
and Mr. Carlyle has certainly not taken it sufficiently
into account as a determining cause
of his skepticism.</p>

<p>But whatever subject Mr. Carlyle takes up,
and whether he be right or wrong in his opinions,
he is sure to write an interesting book.
He is never wearisome, and whether his tale
have been twice told or not, he clothes it by
his original treatment with an attractive
charm that few writers can lend even to an
entirely new subject. The maxim of the author
of <i>Modern Antiquity</i>, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"True genius is the ray that flings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A novel light o'er common things,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>has seldom been better illustrated than by
this life of Sterling. The facts are most of
them neither new nor of a nature in themselves
to excite any very strong interest, but
the details of the life are told with such simplicity,
and yet with such constant reference
to the grand educational process which they
collectively make up, that one seems listening
to a narrative by Sterling's guardian angel,
loving enough to sympathize in the smallest
minuti&aelig;, and wise enough to see in each of
them the greatness of the crowning result.
Nor is this impression in the least impaired
by the insignificance of the sum total of Sterling's
actual achievements. For had they
been tenfold greater than they were, they
would have been as nothing in the presence
of that which Mr. Carlyle looks to as the
soul's great achievement&mdash;heroic nobleness
of struggle and a calm abiding of the issue.
After noticing the purity of Sterling's character,
and his conformity to "the so-called
moralities," his biographer goes on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In clear and perfect fidelity to Truth wherever
found, in childlike and soldierlike, pious and valiant
loyalty to the Highest, and what of good and
evil that might send him,&mdash;he excelled among good
men. The joys and the sorrows of his lot he took
with true simplicity and acquiescence. Like a
true son, not like a miserable mutinous rebel, he
comported himself in this Universe. Extremity
of distress&mdash;and surely his fervid temper had
enough of contradiction in this world,&mdash;could not
tempt him into impatience at any time. By no
chance did you ever hear from him a whisper of
those mean repinings, miserable arraignings and
questionings of the Eternal Power, such as weak
souls even well disposed will sometimes give way
to in the pressure of their despair; to the like of
this he never yielded, or showed the least tendency
to yield;&mdash;which surely was well on his part.
For the Eternal Power, I still remark, will not
answer the like of this, but silently and terribly
accounts it impious, blasphemous, and damnable,
and now as heretofore will visit it as such. Not a
rebel but a son, I said; willing to suffer when
Heaven said, Thou shalt;&mdash;and withal, what is
perhaps rarer in such a combination, willing to rejoice
also, and right cheerily taking the good that
was sent, whensoever or in whatever form it came.</p>

<p>"A pious soul we may justly call him; devoutly
submissive to the will of the Supreme in all things:
the highest and sole essential form which Religion
can assume in man, and without which all forms of
religion are a mockery and a delusion in man."</p></div>

<p>Every one not personally acquainted with
Sterling will feel that the great interest of the
book is in the light thrown by it on Mr. Carlyle's
own belief. For good or evil, Mr. Carlyle
is a power in the country; and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
who watch eagerly the signs of the times
have their eyes fixed upon him. What he
would have us leave is plain enough, and
that too with all haste, as a sinking ship that
will else carry us&mdash;state, church, and sacred
property&mdash;down along with it. But whither
would he have us fly? Is there firm land, be
it ever so distant? or is the wild waste of
waters, seething, warring round as far as eye
can reach, our only hope? the pilot-stars,
shining fitfully through the parting of the
storm-clouds, our only guidance? There are
hearts on this land almost broken, whose old
traditional beliefs, serving them at least as
moral supports, Mr. Carlyle and teachers like
him have undermined. Some betake themselves
to literature, as Sterling did; some fill
up the void with the excitement of politics;
others feebly bemoan their irreparable loss,
and wear an outward seeming of universal
irony and sarcasm. Mr. Carlyle has no right,
no man has any right, to weaken or destroy
a faith which he cannot or will not replace
with a loftier. We have no hesitation in saying,
that the language which Mr. Carlyle is in
the habit of employing towards the religion
of England and of Europe is unjustifiable.
He ought to have said nothing, or he ought
to have said more. Scraps of verse from
Goethe, and declamations, however brilliantly
they may be phrased, are but a poor compensation
for the slightest obscuring of "the hope
of immortality brought to light by the gospel,"
and by it conveyed to the hut of the
poorest man, to awaken, his crushed intelligence
and lighten the load of his misery. Mr.
Carlyle slights, after his contemptuous fashion,
the poetry of his contemporaries: one of
them has uttered in song some practical wisdom
which he would do well to heed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O thou that after toil and storm<br /></span>
<span class="i2">May'st seem to have reached a purer air,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose faith has centre everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor cares to fix itself to form,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Leave thou thy sister, when she prays,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her early heaven, her happy views;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor thou with shadowed hint confuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A life that leads melodious days.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her faith through form is pure as thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her hands are quicker unto good.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, sacred be the flesh and blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which she links a truth divine!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"See thou, that countest reason ripe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In holding by the law within,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou fail not in a world of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even for want of such a type."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This life of Sterling will be useful to the
class whose beliefs have given way before
Mr. Carlyle's destroying energies; because it
furnishes hints, not to be mistaken though
not obtrusive, as to the extent to which they
must be prepared to go if they would really
be his disciples. If the path has in its very
dangers an attraction for some, while others
are shudderingly repelled, in either case the
result is desirable, as it is the absence of certainty
which causes the pain and paralyzes
the power of action. At any rate, the doctrines
of this teacher must be so much more
intelligible to the mass when applied, as they
are here, in commentary upon a life all whose
details are familiar, because it is the life of a
contemporary and a countryman, that all
who read must inevitably be impressed with
that great lesson of the philosophic poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The intellectual power through words and things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes sounding on, <i>a dim and perilous way</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Though John Sterling is of course the principal
figure in the composition, and Mr. Carlyle's
treatment the great attraction of the
book, yet the figures in the background will
be those to make most impression on the general
reader. Coleridge stands there in striking
but caricatured likeness; and even his
most devoted admirers will not be sorry to
see a portrait of their master by such a hand:
and all will curiously observe the contrast
between the sarcastic bitterness which colors
the drawing of the philosophic Christian, and
the kindly allowance through which the character
of John Sterling's father, the famous
"Thunderer" of the <i>Times</i>, is delineated.
We half suspect that Coleridge would have
appeared to Mr. Carlyle a much greater man,
if he had allowed him to declaim&mdash;"Harpocrates-Stentor,"
as Sterling calls him&mdash;with
trumpet voice and for time unlimited on the
divine virtues of Silence. There are besides,
as in all Mr. Carlyle's works, passages of wise
thought expressed in most felicitous language:
of which not the least important is this advice
given to Sterling in reference to his poetic
aspirations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"You can speak with supreme excellence; sing
with considerable excellence you never can. And
the Age itself, does it not, beyond most ages, demand
and require clear speech; an Age incapable
of being sung to, in any but a trivial manner,
till these convulsive agonies and wild revolutionary
overturnings readjust themselves? Intelligible
word of command, not musical psalmody and
fiddling, is possible in this fell storm of battle.
Beyond all ages, our Age admonishes whatsoever
thinking or writing man it has: Oh speak to me,
some wise intelligible speech; your wise meaning,
in the shortest and clearest way; behold, I am
dying for want of wise meaning, and insight into
the devouring fact: speak, if you have any wisdom!
As to song so-called, and your fiddling talent,&mdash;even
if you have one, much more if you
have none,&mdash;we will talk of that a couple of centuries
hence, when things are calmer again. Homer
shall be thrice welcome; but only when Troy
is <i>taken</i>: alas, while the siege lasts, and battle's
fury rages every where, what can I do with the
Homer? I want Achilleus and Odysseus, and
am enraged to see them trying to be Homers!&mdash;"</p></div>

<p>These bricks from Babylon convey but
scanty intimation of the varied interest of the
book. However the readers of it may differ
from its opinions, they cannot but find, even
in Mr. Carlyle's misjudgments and prejudices,
ample matter for serious reflection: for if he
misjudges, it is generally because he is looking
too intently at a single truth, or a single
side of a truth; and such misjudgments are
more suggestive than the completest propositions
of a less earnest, keen-sighted, and impassioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
thinker. He is indeed more a prophet
than a logician or a man of science.
And one lesson we may all learn from this,
as from everything he writes,&mdash;and it is a
lesson that interferes with no creed,&mdash;that
honesty of purpose, and resoluteness to do
and to say the thing we believe to be the
true thing, will give heart to a man's life,
when all ordinary motives to action and all
ordinary supports of energy have failed like
a rotten reed.</p>

<p>The new nautical story by the always successful
author of <i>Typee</i>, has for its name-giving
subject a monster first introduced to
the world of print by Mr. J. N. Reynolds, ten
or fifteen years ago, in a paper for the <i>Knickerbocker</i>,
entitled <i>Mocha Dick</i>. We received
a copy when it was too late to review it ourselves
for this number of the <i>International</i>,
and therefore make use of a notice of it which
we find in the London <i>Spectator</i>:</p>

<p>"This sea novel is a singular medley of
naval observation, magazine article writing,
satiric reflection upon the conventionalisms
of civilized life, and rhapsody run mad. So
far as the nautical parts are appropriate and
unmixed, the portraiture is truthful and interesting.
Some of the satire, especially in
the early parts, is biting and reckless. The
chapter-spinning is various in character; now
powerful from the vigorous and fertile fancy
of the author, now little more than empty
though sounding phrases. The rhapsody belongs
to wordmongering where ideas are the
staple; where it takes the shape of narrative
or dramatic fiction, it is phantasmal&mdash;an
attempted description of what is impossible
in nature and without probability in art; it
repels the reader instead of attracting him.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The Whale. By Herman Melville, Author of "Typee,"
"Omoo," "Redburn," "Mardi," "White Jacket."
In three volumes. Published by Bentley.</p>
<p>[Moby Dick, or the Whale: By Herman Melville: 1 vol.
12mo. New-York, Harper &amp; Brothers.]</p></div>

<p>"The elements of the story are a South Sea
whaling voyage, narrated by Ishmael, one of
the crew of the ship Pequod, from Nantucket.
Its 'probable' portions consist of the
usual sea matter in that branch of the industrial
marine; embracing the preparations
for departure, the voyage, the chase and
capture of whale, with the economy of cutting
up, &amp;c., and the peculiar discipline of
the service. This matter is expanded by a
variety of digressions on the nature and
characteristics of the sperm whale, the history
of the fishery, and similar things, in
which a little knowledge is made the excuse
for a vast many words. The voyage is introduced
by several chapters in which life in
American seaports is rather broadly depicted.</p>

<p>"The 'marvellous' injures the book by
disjointing the narrative, as well as by its inherent
want of interest, at least as managed
by Mr. Melville. In the superstition of some
whalers, (grounded upon the malicious foresight
which occasionally characterizes the attacks
of the sperm fish upon the boats sent
to capture it,) there is a <i>white</i> whale which
possesses supernatural power. To capture
or even to hurt it is beyond the art of man;
the skill of the whaler is useless; the harpoon
does not wound it; it exhibits a contemptuous
strategy in its attacks upon the
boats of its pursuers; and happy is the vessel
were only loss of limb, or of a single life,
attends its chase. Ahab, the master of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>Pequod&mdash;a mariner of long experience, stern
resolve, and indomitable courage, the high
hero of romance, in short, transferred to a
whale-ship&mdash;has lost his leg in a contest with
the white whale. Instead of daunting Ahab,
the loss exasperates him; and by long brooding
over it his reason becomes shaken. In
this condition, he undertakes the voyage;
making the chase of his fishy antagonist the
sole abject of his thoughts, and, so far as he
can without exciting overt insubordination
among his officers, the object of his proceedings.</p>

<p>"Such a groundwork is hardly natural
enough for a regular-built novel, though it
might form a tale, if properly managed.
But Mr. Melville's mysteries provoke wonder
at the author rather than terror at the creation;
the soliloquies and dialogues of Ahab,
in which the author attempts delineating the
wild imaginings of monomania, and exhibiting
some profoundly speculative views of
things in general, induce weariness or skipping;
while the whole scheme mars, as we
have said, the nautical continuity of story&mdash;greatly
assisted by various chapters of a
bookmaking kind.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the earliest chapters are the
best although they contain little adventure.
Their topics are fresher to English readers
than the whale-chase, and they have more
direct satire. One of the leading personages
in the voyage is Queequeg, a South Sea Islander,
that Ishmael falls in with at New-Bedford,
and with whom he forms a bosom
friendship.</p>

<p>"Queequeg was a native of Kokovoko, an island
far away to the West and South. It is not down
in any map; true places never are.</p>

<p>"While yet a new-hatched savage, running wild
about his native woodlands in a grass clout, followed
by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
sapling,&mdash;even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul
lurked a strong desire to see something more of
Christendom than a specimen whaler or two.
His father was a high chief, a king; his uncle a
high priest; and on the maternal side he boasted
aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors.
There was excellent blood in his veins&mdash;royal
stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the
cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored
youth.</p>

<p>"A Sag Harbour ship visited his father's bay;
and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands.
But the ship having her full complement of seamen,
spurned his suit; and not all the King his
father's influence could prevail. But Queequeg
vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off
to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must
pass through when she quitted the island. On
one side was a coral reef; on the other a low
tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets,
that grew out into the water. Hiding his canoe,
still afloat, among these thickets, with its prow
seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in
hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like a
flash he darted out&mdash;gained her side&mdash;with one
backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his
canoe&mdash;climbed up the chains&mdash;and throwing
himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a
ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go though
hacked in pieces.</p>

<p>"In vain the captain threatened to throw him
overboard&mdash;suspended a cutlass over his naked
wrists: Queequeg was the son of a king, and
Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate
dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit Christendom,
the captain at last relented, and told him
he might make himself at home. But this fine
young savage&mdash;this sea Prince of Whales&mdash;never
saw the captain's cabin. They put him down
among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.
But, like the Czar Peter content to toil in the
ship-yards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained
no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might haply
gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen.
For at bottom&mdash;so he told me&mdash;he was actuated
by a profound desire to learn among the
Christians the arts whereby to make his people still
happier than they were, and more than that, still
better than they were. But, alas! the practices of
whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians
could be both miserable and wicked, infinitely
more so than all his father's heathens. Arrived
at last in old Sag Harbour, and seeing what
the sailors did there, and then going on to Nantucket,
and seeing how they spent their wages in
that place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for lost.
Thought he, it's a wicked world in all meridians:
I'll die a Pagan.</p>

<p>"The strongest point of the book is its
'characters.' Ahab, indeed, is a melodramatic
exaggeration, and Ishmael is little
more than a mouthpiece; but the harpooners,
the mates, and several of the seamen,
are truthful portraitures of the sailor as modified
by the whaling service. The persons
ashore are equally good, though they are soon
lost sight of. The two Quaker owners are
the author's means for a hit at the religious
hypocrisies. Captain Bildad, an old sea-dog,
has got rid of every thing pertaining to the
meeting-house save an occasional 'thou' and
'thee.' Captain Peleg, in American phrase,
'professes religion.' The following extract
exhibits the two men when Ishmael is shipped:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I began to think that it was high time to settle
with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage
for the voyage. I was already aware that
in the whaling business they paid no wages, but
all hands, including the captain, received certain
shares of the profits, called <i>lays</i>; and that these
lays were proportioned to the degree of importance
pertaining to the respective duties of the
ship's company. I was also aware that, being a
green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be
very large: but, considering that I was used to
the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all
that, I made no doubt that, from all I had heard,
I should be offered at least the two hundred and
seventy-fifth lay&mdash;that is, the two hundred and
seventy-fifth part of the clear net proceeds of the
voyage, whatever that might eventually amount
to. And though the two hundred and seventy-fifth
lay was what they called a rather <i>long lay</i>,
yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a
lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the
clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
my three years' beef and board, for which I would
not have to pay one stiver.</p>

<p>"It might be thought that this was a poor way
to accumulate a princely fortune: and so it was,
a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those
that never take on about princely fortunes, and
am quite content if the world is ready to board
and lodge me while I am putting up at this grim
sign of the Thunder-cloud. Upon the whole, I
thought that the two hundred and seventy-fifth lay
would be about the fair thing, but would not have
been surprised had I been offered the two hundredth,
considering I was of a broad-shouldered
make.</p>

<p>"But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a
little distrustful about receiving a generous share
of the profits, was this: ashore, I had heard something
of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable
old crony Bildad; how that they, being the principal
proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and
more in considerable and scattered owners left
nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs
to these two. And I did not know but that the
stingy old Bildad might have a deal to say about
shipping hands, especially as I now found him on
board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin,
and reading his Bible, as if at his own fireside.
Now, while Peleg was vainly trying to
mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my
no small surprise, considering that he was such an
interested party in these proceedings&mdash;Bildad never
heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself
out of his book, '<i>Lay</i> not up for yourselves treasures
upon earth, where moth&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Well, Captain Bildad,' interrupted Peleg,
'what d'ye say&mdash;what lay shall we give this
young man?'</p>

<p>"'Thou knowest best,' was the sepulchral reply;
'the seven hundred and seventy-seventh
wouldn't be too much&mdash;would it&mdash;'where moth
and rust do corrupt, but <i>lay</i>&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Lay indeed, thought I, and such a lay!&mdash;the
seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old
Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall
not <i>lay</i> up many <i>lays</i> here below, where moth
and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly <i>long
lay</i> that, indeed; and though from the magnitude
of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman,
yet the slightest consideration will show that,
though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a
pretty large number, yet when you come to make
a <i>teenth</i> of it, you will then see, I say, that the
seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing
is a good deal less than seven hundred and
seventy-seven gold doubloons. And so I thought
at the time.</p>

<p>"'Why, b&mdash;&mdash; t your eyes, Bildad!' cried Peleg,
'thou dost not want to swindle this young man!
he must have more than that?'</p>

<p>"'Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,' again
said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then
went on mumbling&mdash;'for where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also.'</p>

<p>"'I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,'
said Peleg; 'do ye hear that, Bildad? The
three hundredth lay, I say.'</p>

<p>"Bildad laid down his book, and, turning solemnly
towards him, said, 'Captain Peleg, thou
hast a generous heart; but thou must consider
the duty thou owest to the other owners of this
ship&mdash;widows and orphans, many of them; and
that, if we too abundantly reward the labors of
this young man, we may be taking the bread
from those widows and those orphans. The seven
hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain
Peleg.'</p>

<p>"'Thou Bildad!' roared Peleg, starting up, and
clattering about the cabin, 'B&mdash;&mdash; t ye, Captain
Bildad; if I had followed thy advice in these
matters, I would afore now had a conscience to
lug about that would be heavy enough to founder
the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape
Horn.'</p>

<p>"'Captain Peleg,' said Bildad steadily, 'thy
conscience may be drawing ten inches of water or
ten fathoms&mdash;I can't tell; but as thou art still an
impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest
thy conscience be but a leaky one, and will in the
end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit,
Captain Peleg,'"</p></div>

<p>"It is a canon with some critics that nothing
should be introduced into a novel which it is
physically impossible for the writer to have
known: thus, he must not describe the conversation
of miners in a pit if they <i>all</i> perish.
Mr. Melville hardly steers clear of this rule,
and he continually violates another, by beginning
in the autobiographical form and
changing <i>ad libitum</i> into the narrative. His
catastrophe overrides all rule: not only is
Ahab, with his boat's-crew, destroyed in his
last desperate attack upon the white whale,
but the Pequod herself sinks with all on board
into the depths of the illimitable ocean. Such
is the go-ahead method."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER L.</h3>

<p>Sir Philip Hastings, I have said, was reading
a Greek book when Mr. Short entered
the library. His face was grave, and very
stern; but all traces of the terrible agitation
with which he had quited the side of his wife's
death-bed, were now gone from his face. He
hardly looked up when the surgeon entered.
He seemed not only reading, but absorbed by
what he read. Mr. Short thought the paroxysm
of grief was passed, and that the mind
of Sir Philip Hastings, settling down into a
calm melancholy, was seeking its habitual relief
in books. He knew, as every medical
man must know, the various whimsical resources
to which the heart of man flies, as
if for refuge, in moments of great affliction.
The trifles with which some will occupy
themselves&mdash;the intense abstraction for which
others will labor&mdash;the imaginations, the visions,
the fancies to which others again will
apply, not for consolation, not for comfort;
but for escape from the one dark predominant
idea. He said a few words to Sir Philip
then, of a kindly but somewhat commonplace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>character, and the baronet looked up, gazing
at him across the candles which stood upon
the library table. Had Mr. Short's attention
been particularly called to Sir Philip's countenance,
he would have perceived at once,
that the pupils of the eyes were strangely and
unnaturally contracted, and that from time
to time a certain nervous twitching of the
muscles curled the lip, and indented the cheek.
But he did not remark these facts: he merely
saw that Sir Philip was reading: that he
had recovered his calmness; and he judged
that that which might be strange in other
men, might not be strange in him. In regard
to what he believed the great cause of Sir
Philip's grief, his wife's death, he thought it
better to say nothing; but he naturally concluded
that a father would be anxious to hear
of a daughter's health under such circumstances,
and therefore he told him that Emily was
better and more composed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Concluded from page 499.</p>
<p>Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850,
by G. P. R. James, in the Clerk's Office of the District
Court of the United States for the Southern District of
New-York.</p></div>

<p>Sir Philip made a slight, but impatient motion
of the hand, but Mr. Short went on to
say, "As she was so severely and terribly affected,
Sir Philip, I have given Mistress Emily
a composing draught, which has already
had the intended effect of throwing her into
profound slumber. It will insure her, I think,
at least six, if not seven hours of calm repose,
and I trust she will rise better able to
bear her grief than she would be now, were
she conscious of it."</p>

<p>Sir Philip muttered something between his
teeth which the surgeon did not hear, and
Mr. Short proceeded, saying, "Will you permit
me to suggest, Sir Philip, that it would
be better for you too, my dear sir, to take
something which would counteract the depressing
effect of sorrow."</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir, I thank you," replied Sir
Philip, laying his hand upon the book; "I
have no need. The mind under suffering
seeks medicines for the mind. The body is
not affected. It is well&mdash;too well. Here is
my doctor;" and he raised his hand and let it
fall upon the book again.</p>

<p>"Well then, I will leave you for to-night,
Sir Philip," said the surgeon; "to-morrow I
must intrude upon you on business of great
importance. I will now take my leave."</p>

<p>Sir Philip rose ceremoniously from his chair
and bowed his head; gazing upon the surgeon
as he left the room and shut the door,
with a keen, cunning, watchful look from under
his overhanging eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he said, when the surgeon had left
the room, "he thought to catch me&mdash;to find
out what I intended to do&mdash;slumber!&mdash;calm,
tranquil repose&mdash;so near a murdered mother!
God of heaven!" and he bent down his head
till his forehead touched the pages of the
book, and remained with his face thus concealed
for several minutes.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that not one person,
with a single exception, to whom the circumstances
of Lady Hastings' death were known,
even dreamed of suspecting Emily. They all
knew her, comprehended her character, loved
her, had faith in her, except her own unhappy
father. But with him, if the death of his
unhappy wife were terrible, his suspicions of
his daughter were a thousand fold more so.
To his distorted vision a multitude of circumstances
brought proof all powerful. "She
has tried to destroy her father," he thought,
"and she has not scrupled to destroy her
mother. In the one case there seemed no
object. In the other there was the great object
of revenge, with others perhaps more
mean, but not less potent. Try her cause
what way I will, the same result appears.
The mother opposes the daughter's marriage
to the man she loves&mdash;threatens to frustrate
the dearest wish of her heart&mdash;and nothing
but death will satisfy her. This is the end
then of all these reveries&mdash;these alternate
fits of gloom and levity. The ill balanced
mind has lost its equipoise, and all has given
way to passion. But what must I do&mdash;oh
God! what must I do?"</p>

<p>His thoughts are here given, not exactly as
they presented themselves; for they were
more vague, confused, and disjointed; but
such was the sum and substance of them. He
raised his head from the book and looked up,
and after thinking for a moment or two he
said, "This Josephus&mdash;this Jew&mdash;gives numerous
instances, if I remember right, of justice
done by fathers upon their children&mdash;ay,
and by the express command of God. The
priest of the Most High was punished for
yielding to human weakness in the case of
his sons. The warrior Jephtha spared not his
best beloved. What does the Roman teach?
Not to show pity to those the nearest to us by
blood, the closest in affection, where justice demands
unwavering execution. It must be so.
There is but the choice left, to give her over
to hands of strangers, to add public shame,
and public punishment to that which justice
demands, or to do that myself which they
must inevitably do. She must die&mdash;such a
monster must not remain upon the earth.
She has plotted against her father's life&mdash;she
has colleagued with his fraudulent enemies&mdash;she
has betrayed the heart that fondly trusted
her&mdash;she has visited secretly the haunts
of a low, vulgar ruffian&mdash;she has aided and
abetted those who have plundered her own
parents&mdash;she has ended by the murder of
the mother who so fondly loved her. I&mdash;I
am bound, by every duty to society, to deliver
it from one, who for my curse, and its
bane, I brought into the world. She must
be put to death; and no hand but mine must
do it."</p>

<p>He gazed gloomily down upon the table for
several minutes, and then paced the room
rapidly with agony in every line of his face.
He wrung his hands hard together. He lifted
up his eyes towards heaven, and often,
often, he cried out, "Oh God! Oh God! Is
there no hope?&mdash;no doubt?&mdash;no opening for
pause or hesitation?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span></p>

<p>"None, none, none," he said at length, and
sank down into his chair again.</p>

<p>His eye wandered round the room, as if
seeking some object he could not see, and
then he murmured, "So beautiful&mdash;so young&mdash;so
engaging&mdash;just eighteen summers; and
yet such a load of crime!"</p>

<p>He bent his head again, and a few drops
of agony fell from his eyes upon the table.
Then clasping his forehead tight with his hand,
he remained for several minutes thoughtful
and silent. He seemed to grow calmer; but
it was a deceitful seeming; and there was a
wild, unnatural light in his eyes which, notwithstanding
all the apparent shrewdness of
his reasoning&mdash;the seeming connection and
clearness of his argument, would have shown
to those expert in such matters, that there
was something not right within the brain.</p>

<p>At length he said to himself in a whisper,
as if he was afraid that some one should hear
him, "She sleeps&mdash;the man said she sleeps&mdash;now
is the time&mdash;I must not hesitate&mdash;I must
not falter&mdash;now is the time!" and he rose
and approached the door.</p>

<p>Once, he stopped for a moment&mdash;once,
doubt and irresolution took possession of him.
But then he cast them off, and moved on
again.</p>

<p>With a slow step, but firm and noiseless
tread, he crossed the hall and mounted the
stairs. No one saw him: the servants were
scattered: there was no one to oppose his
progress, or to say, "Forbear!"</p>

<p>He reached his daughter's room, opened
the door quietly, went in, and closed it. Then
he gazed eagerly around. The curtains were
withdrawn: his fair, sweet child lay sleeping
calmly as an infant. He could see all around.
Father and child were there. There was no
one else.</p>

<p>Still he gazed around, seeking perhaps for
something with which to do the fatal deed!
His eye rested on a packet of papers upon
the table. It contained those which Marlow
had left with poor gentle Emily to justify her
to her father in case of need.</p>

<p>Oh, would he but take them up! Would
he but read the words within!</p>

<p>He turns away&mdash;he steals toward the bed!</p>

<p>Drop the curtain! I can write no more.</p>

<p>Emily is gone!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER LI.</h3>

<p>When Mr. Short, the surgeon, left the presence
of Sir Philip Hastings, he found the
butler seated in an arm-chair in the hall, cogitating
sadly over all the lamentable events
of the day. He was an old servant of the family,
and full of that personal interest in
every member of it which now, alas, in these
times of improvement and utilitarianism (or
as it should be called, selfishness reduced to
rule), when it seems to be the great object of
every one to bring men down to the level of
a mere machine, is no longer, or very rarely,
met with. He rose as soon as the surgeon
appeared, and inquired eagerly after his poor
master. "I am afraid he is touched here,
sir," he said, laying his finger on his forehead.
"He has not been at all right ever since he
came back from London, and I am sure,
when he came down to-night, calling out in
such a way about gathering herbs, I thought
he had gone clean crazy."</p>

<p>"He has become quite calm and composed
now," replied Mr. Short; "though of course
he is very sad: but as I can do no good by
staying with him, I must go down to the
farm for my horse, and ride away where my
presence is immediately wanted."</p>

<p>"They have brought your horse up from
the farm, sir," said the butler. "It is in the
stable-yard."</p>

<p>Thither Mr. Short immediately proceeded,
mounted, and rode away. When he had
gone about five miles, or perhaps a little
more, he perceived that two horsemen were
approaching him rapidly, and he looked sharp
towards them, thinking they might be Mr.
Atkinson and the groom. As they came
near, the outlines of the figures showed him
that such was not the case; but the foremost
of the two pulled up suddenly as he was passing,
and Marlow's voice exclaimed, "Is that
Mr. Short?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, yes, Mr. Marlow," replied the
surgeon. "I am very glad indeed you have
come; for there has been terrible work this
day at the house of poor Sir Philip Hastings.
Lady Hastings is no more, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have heard the whole sad history," replied
Marlow, "and am riding as fast as possible
to see what can be done for Sir Philip,
and my poor Emily. I only stopped to tell
you that Mrs. Hazleton has been taken, the
vial of medicine found upon her, and that she
has boldly confessed the fact of having poisoned
poor Lady Hastings. You will find
her and Atkinson, the high constable, at the
house of Mrs. Warmington.&mdash;Good night, Mr.
Short; good night;" and Marlow spurred on
again.</p>

<p>The delay had been very short, but it was
fatal.</p>

<p>When Marlow reached the front entrance
of the court, he threw his rein to the groom,
and without the ceremony of ringing, entered
the house. There was a lamp burning in
the hall, which was vacant; but Marlow
heard a step upon the great staircase, and
looked up. A dark shadowy figure was coming
staggering down, and as it entered the
sphere of the light in the hall, Marlow recognized
the form, rather than the features, of
Sir Philip Hastings. His face was ashy pale:
not a trace of color was discernible in any
part: the very lips were white; and the
gray hair stood ragged and wild upon his
head. His haggard and sunken eye fell upon
Marlow; but he was passing onward to the
library, as if he did not know him, tottering
and reeling like a drunken man, when Marlow,
very much shocked, stopped him, exclaiming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
"Good God, Sir Philip, do you no
know me?"</p>

<p>The unhappy man started, turned round
and grasped him tightly by the wrist, saying
in a hoarse whisper, and looking over his
shoulder towards the staircase, "Do not go
there, do not go there&mdash;come hither&mdash;you
do not know what has happened."</p>

<p>"I do, indeed, Sir Philip," replied Marlow
in a soothing tone, "I have heard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, no!" said Sir Philip Hastings.
"No one knows but I&mdash;there was no
one there&mdash;I did it all myself.&mdash;Come hither,
I say!" and he drew Marlow on towards the
library.</p>

<p>"He has lost his senses," thought Marlow.
"I must try and soothe him before I see my
poor Emily. I will try and turn his mind to
other things;" and, suffering himself to be
led forward, he entered the library with Sir
Philip Hastings, who instantly cast himself
into a chair, and pressed his hands before his
eyes.</p>

<p>Marlow stood and gazed at him for a moment
in silent compassion, and then he said,
"Take comfort, Sir Philip. Take comfort.
I bring you a great store of news; and what
I have to tell will require great bodily and
mental exertions from you, to deal with all
the painful circumstances in which you are
placed. I have followed out every thread of
the shameful conspiracy against you&mdash;not a
turning of the whole rascally scheme is undiscovered."</p>

<p>"She had her share in that too," said Sir
Philip, looking up in his face, with a wild,
uncertain sort of questioning look.</p>

<p>"I know it," replied Marlow, thinking he
spoke of Mrs. Hazleton, "She was the prime
mover in it all."</p>

<p>Sir Philip wrung his hands tight, one within
the other, murmuring "Oh, God; oh,
God!"</p>

<p>"But," continued Marlow, "she will soon
expiate her crimes; for she has been taken,
and proofs of her guilt found upon her, so
strong and convincing, that she did not think
fit even to conceal the fact, but confessed her
crime at once."</p>

<p>Sir Philip started, and grasped both the
arms of the chair in which he sat, tight in
his thin white hands, gazing at Marlow with
a look of bewildered horror that cannot be
described. Marlow went on, however, saying,
"I had previously told her, indeed, that
I had discovered all her dark and treacherous
schemes&mdash;how she had labored to make
this whole family miserable&mdash;how she had
attempted to blacken the character of my
dear Emily&mdash;imitated her handwriting&mdash;induced
you to misunderstand her whole conduct,
and thrown dark hints and suspicions
in your way. She knew that she could not
escape this charge, even if she could conceal
her guilt of to-day, and she confessed the
whole."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who&mdash;who?" cried Sir Philip
Hastings, almost in a scream. "Of whom
are you talking, man?"</p>

<p>"Of Mrs. Hazleton," replied Marlow.
"Were you not speaking of her?"</p>

<p>Sir Philip Hastings stretched forth his
hands, as if to push him farther from him;
but his only reply was a deep groan, and,
after a moment's pause, Marlow proceeded,
"I thought you were speaking of her&mdash;of
her whose task it has been, ever since poor
Emily's ill-starred visit to her house, to calumniate
and wrong that dear innocent girl&mdash;to
make you think her guilty of bitter indiscretions,
if not great crimes&mdash;who, more than
any one, aided to wrong you, and who now
openly avows that she placed the poison in
your poor wife's room in order to destroy
her."</p>

<p>"And I have killed her!&mdash;and I have killed
her!" cried Sir Philip Hastings, rising up
erect and tall&mdash;"and I have killed her!"</p>

<p>"Good God, whom?" exclaimed Marlow,
with his heart beating as if it would burst
through his side. "Whom do you mean,
sir?"</p>

<p>Sir Philip remained silent for a moment,
pressing his hands tight upon his temples,
and then answered in a slow, solemn voice,
"Your Emily&mdash;my Emily&mdash;my own sweet&mdash;"
but he did not finish the sentence; for ere
the last words could be uttered, he fell forward
on the floor like a dead man.</p>

<p>For an instant, stupified and horror-struck,
Marlow remained motionless, hardly comprehending,
hardly believing what he had
heard. The next instant, however, he rushed
out of the library, and found the butler
with the late Lady Hastings' maid, passing
through the back of the house towards the
front staircase.</p>

<p>"Which is Emily's room?" he cried,&mdash;"Which
is Emily's room?"</p>

<p>"She is asleep, sir," said the maid.</p>

<p>"Which is her room?" cried Marlow, vehemently.
"He is mad&mdash;he is mad&mdash;your
master is mad&mdash;he says he has killed her.
Which is her room?" and he darted up the
staircase.</p>

<p>"The third on the right, sir," cried the
butler, following with the maid, as fast as
possible; and Marlow darted towards the
door.</p>

<p>A fit of trembling, however, seized him as
he laid his hand upon the lock. "He must
have exaggerated," he said to himself. "He
has been unkind&mdash;harsh&mdash;he calls that killing
her&mdash;I will open it gently," and he and
the two servants entered it nearly together.</p>

<p>All was quiet. All was still. The light
was burning on the table. There was a large
heavy pillow cast down by the side of the
bed, and the bed coverings were in some disorder.</p>

<p>No need of such a stealthy pace, Marlow!
You may tread firm and boldly. Even your
beloved step will not wake her. The body
sleeps till the day of judgment. The spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
has gone where the wicked cease from troubling,
and the weary are at rest.</p>

<p>The beautiful face was calm and tranquil;
though beneath each of the closed eyes was
a deep bluish mark, and the lips had lost
their redness. The fair delicate hands grasped
the bed-clothes tightly, and the whole position
of the figure showed that death had
not taken place without a convulsive struggle.
Marlow tried, with trembling hands,
to unclasp the fingers from the bed-clothes,
and though he could not do it, he fancied he
felt warmth in the palms of the hands. A
momentary gleam of hope came upon him.
More assistance was called: every effort that
could be suggested was made; but it was
all in vain. Consciousness&mdash;breath&mdash;life&mdash;could
never be restored. There was not a
dry eye amongst all those around, when the
young lover, giving up the hopeless task, cast
himself on his knees by the bedside, and
pressed his face upon the dead hand of her
whom he had loved so well.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the voice of Sir Philip
Hastings was heard below singing a stanza
of some light song. It was the most horrible
sound that ever was heard!</p>

<p>Two of the servants ran down in haste, and
the sight of the living was as terrible as that
of the dead. Philip Hastings had recovered
from his fit without assistance, had raised
himself, and was now walking about the room
with the same sort of zigzag, tottering step
with which he had met Marlow on his return.
A stream of blood from a wound which he
had inflicted on his forehead when he fell,
was still pouring down his face, rendering its
deathlike paleness only the more ghastly.
His mouth was slightly drawn aside, giving
a strange sinister expression to his countenance;
but from his eyes, once so full of
thought and intellect, every trace of reason
had vanished. He held his hands before him,
and the fingers of the one beat time upon the
back of the other to the air that he was singing,
and which he continued to sing even after
the entrance of the servants. He uttered
not a word to them on their appearance:
he took not the slightest notice of them till
the butler, seeing his condition, took him by
the arm, and asked if he had not better go
to bed.</p>

<p>Then, Sir Philip attempted to answer, but
his words when spoken were indistinct as well
as confused, and it became evident that he had
a stroke of palsy. The servants knew hardly
what to do. Marlow they did not dare to disturb
in his deep grief: the surgeon was by this
time far away: their mistress, and her fair
unhappy daughter were dead: their master
had become an idiot. It was the greatest
possible relief to them when they beheld
Mr. Dixwell the clergyman enter the library.
Some boy employed about the stables or the
kitchen, had carried down a vague tale of the
horrors to the Rectory; and the good clergyman,
though exhausted with all the fatigues
and anxiety of the day, had hurried down
at once to see what could be done for the
survivors of that doomed family. He comprehended
the situation of Sir Philip Hastings
in a moment; but he put many questions to
the butler as to what preceded the terrible
event, the effects of which he beheld. The
old servant answered little. To most of the
questions he merely shook his head sadly;
but that mute reply was sufficient; and Mr.
Dixwell, taking Sir Philip by the hand, said,
"You had better retire to rest, sir&mdash;you are
not well."</p>

<p>Sir Philip Hastings gave an unmeaning
smile, but followed the clergyman mildly, and
having seen him to a bedroom, and left him
in the hands of his servants, Mr. Dixwell turned
his step towards the chamber of poor Emily.</p>

<p>Marlow had risen from his knees; but was
still standing by the bedside with his arms
folded on his chest. His face was stern and
sorrowful; but perfectly calm.</p>

<p>Mr. Dixwell approached quietly, and in a
melancholy tone, addressed to him some
words of consolation&mdash;commonplace enough
indeed, but well intended.</p>

<p>Marlow laid his hand upon the clergyman's
arm, and pointed to Emily's beautiful but
ghastly face. He only added, "In vain!&mdash;Do
what is needful&mdash;Do what is right&mdash;I am
incapable;" and leaving the room, he descended
to the library, where he closed the
door, and remained in silence and solitude till
day broke on the following morning.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER LII.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Warmington became a person of some
importance with the people of Hartwell.
All thoughts were turned towards her house.
Everybody wished they could get in and see
and hear more; for the news had spread rapidly
and wide, colored and distorted; but yet
falling far short of the whole terrible truth.
When Mr. Short himself arrived in town,
he found three other magistrates had already
assembled, and that Mr. Atkinson and
Sir Philip Hastings' groom, John, were already
giving them some desultory and informal
information as to the apprehension of
Mr. Hazleton and its causes. The first consideration
after his appearance amongst them,
was what was to be done with the prisoner;
for one of the justices&mdash;a gentleman of old
family in the county, who had not much
liked the appointment of the surgeon to the
bench, and had generally found motives for
differing in opinion with him ever since&mdash;objected
to leaving Mrs. Hazleton, even for the
night, in any other place than the common jail.
The more merciful opinion of the majority,
however, prevailed. Atkinson gave every
assurance that the constable whom he had
placed in charge of the lady was perfectly to
be depended upon, and that the room in
which she was locked up, was too high to admit
the possibility of escape. Thus it was
determined that Mrs. Hazleton should be left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
where she was for the night, and brought
before the magistrates for examination at an
early hour on the following morning.</p>

<p>Even after this decision was come to, however,
the conversation or consultation, if it
may be so called, was prolonged for some
time in a gossiping, idle sort of way. Gentlemen
sat upon the edge of the table with
their hats on, or leaned against the mantelpiece,
beating their boots with their riding-whips,
and some marvelled, and some inquired,
and some expounded the law with
the dignity and confidence, if not with the
sagacity and learning of a Judge. They
were still engaged in this discussion when the
news of Emily's death was brought to Hartwell,
and produced a painful and terrible
sensation in the breasts of the lightest and
most careless of those present. The man
who conveyed the intelligence brought also
a summons to Mr. Short to return immediately
to Sir Philip Hastings, and only waiting
to get a fresh horse, the surgeon set out
upon his return with a very sad and sorrowful
heart. He would not disturb Mr. Marlow;
though he was informed that he was in the
library; but he remained with Sir Philip
Hastings himself during the greater part of
the night, and only set out for his own house
to take a little repose before the meeting of
the magistrates, some quarter of an hour before
the first dawn of day.</p>

<p>Full of painful thoughts he rode on at a
quick pace, till the yellow and russet hues of
the morning began to appear in the east. He
then slackened his pace a little, and naturally,
as he approached the house of Mrs. Warmington,
he raised his eye towards the windows
of the room in which he knew that the
beautiful demon, who had produced so much
misery to others and herself, had been imprisoned.</p>

<p>Mr. Short was riding on; but suddenly a
sound met his ear, and as his eyes ran down
the building from the windows above, to a
small plot of grass which the lady of the
house called the lawn, he drew up his horse,
and rode sharply up to the gate.</p>

<p>But it is time now to turn to Mrs. Hazleton.
Lodged in the upper chamber which
had been decided upon as the one fittest for
their purpose, by Mr. Atkinson and the rest,
with the constable from Hartwell domiciled
in the ante-room, and the door between locked,
Mrs. Hazleton gave herself up to despair;
for her state of mind well deserved that name,
although her feelings were very different from
those which are commonly designated by that
name. Surely to feel that every earthly hope
has passed away&mdash;to see that further struggle
for any object of desire is vain&mdash;to know
that the struggles which have already taken
place have been fruitless&mdash;to feel that their
objects have been base, unworthy, criminal&mdash;to
perceive no gleam of light on either side
of the tomb&mdash;to have the present a wilderness,
the future an abyss, the past and its
memories a hell&mdash;surely this is despair! It
matters not with what firmness, or what
fierceness it may be borne: it matters not
what fiery passions, what sturdy resolutions,
what weak regrets, what agonizing fears, mingle
with the state. This is despair! and
such was the feeling of Mrs. Hazleton. She
saw vast opportunities, a splendid position in
society, wealth, beauty, wit, mind, accomplishments,
all thrown away, and for the gratification
of base passions exchanged for disgrace,
and crime, and a horrible death. It
was a bad bargain; but she felt she had
played her whole for revenge and had lost;
and she abode the issue resolutely.</p>

<p>All these advantages which I have enumerated,
and many more, Mrs. Hazleton had
possessed; but she wanted two things which
are absolutely necessary to human happiness
and human virtue&mdash;heart and principle. The
one she never could have obtained; for by
nature she was heartless. The other might
have been bestowed upon her by her parents.
But they had failed to do so; for their own
proper principles had been too scanty for
them to bestow any on their daughter. Yet,
strange to say, the lack of heart somewhat
mitigated the intensity of the lady's sufferings
now. She felt not her situation as bitterly as
other persons with a greater portion of sensibility
would inevitably have done. She had
so trained herself to resist all small emotions,
that they had in reality become obliterated.
Fiery passions she could feel; for the earthquake
rends the granite which the chisel will
not touch, and these affected her now as
much as ever.</p>

<p>At that very moment, as she sat there, with
her head resting on her hand, what is the
meaning of that stern, knitted brow, that fixed,
steadfast gaze forward, that tight compression
of the lips and teeth? At that moment
Nero's wish was in the bosom of Mrs.
Hazleton. Could she have slaughtered half
the human race to blot out all evidence of her
crimes, and to escape the grinning shame
which she knew awaited her, she would have
done it without remorse. Other feelings, too,
were present. A sense of anger at herself
for having suffered herself to be in the slightest
degree moved or agitated by any thing
that had occurred; a determined effort, too,
was there&mdash;I will not call it a struggle&mdash;to
regain entire command of herself&mdash;to be as
calm, as graceful, as self-possessed, as dignified
as when in high prosperity with unsullied
fame. It might be, in a certain sense, playing
a part, and doubtless the celebrated Madame
Tiquet did the same; but she was playing
a part for her own eyes, as well as those
of others. She resolved to be firm, and she
was firm. "Death," she said, "is before me:
for that I am prepared. It cannot agitate a
nerve, or make a limb shake. All other evils
are trifles compared with this. Why then
should I suffer them to affect me in the least?
No, no, they shall not see me quail!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span></p>

<p>After she had thus thought for some two
hours, gaining more and more self-command
every moment, as she turned and returned
all the points of her situation in her own
mind, and viewed them in every different aspect,
she rose to retire to rest, lay down, and
tried to sleep. At first importunate thought
troubled her. The same kind of ideas went
on&mdash;the same reasonings upon them&mdash;and
slumber for more than one hour would not
visit her eyelids. But she was a very resolute
woman, and at length she determined
that she would not think: she would banish
thought altogether; she would not let the
mind rest for one moment upon any subject
whatsoever; and she succeeded. The absence
of thought is sleep; and she slept; but
resolution ended where sleep begun, and the
images she had banished waking, returned to
the mind in slumber. Her rest was troubled.
Growing fancies seemed to come thick upon
her mind; though the eyes remained closed,
the features were agitated; the lips moved.
Sometimes she laughed; sometimes she moaned
piteously; sometimes tears found their way
through her closed eyelids; and sobs struggled
in her bosom.</p>

<p>At length, between three and four o'clock
in the morning, Mrs. Hazleton rose up in bed.
She opened her eyes, too; but there was a
dull glassy look about them&mdash;a fixed leaden
stare, not natural to her waking hours. Slowly
she got out of bed, approached the table,
took up a candle which she had left burning
there, and which was now nearly down to
the socket, and walked straight to the door,
saying aloud, "Very dark&mdash;very dark&mdash;every
thing is dark."</p>

<p>She tried the door, but found it locked;
and the constable slept on. She then returned
to the table, seated herself, and for
some five or ten minutes continued to twist
her long hair round her fingers. She then
rose again, and went straight to the window,
threw it up, and seemed to look out. "Chilly&mdash;chilly,"
she said. "I must walk to warm
myself."</p>

<p>The sill of the window was somewhat high,
but that was no obstacle; for there was a
chair near, and Mrs. Hazleton placed it for
herself with as much care as if she had been
wide awake. When this was done she stepped
lightly upon it, and put her knee upon the
window-sill, raised herself suddenly upright,
and struck her head sharply against the upper
part of the window. It is probable that
the blow woke her, but at all events it destroyed
her balance, and she fell forward at
once out of the window.</p>

<p>There was a loud shriek, and then a deep
groan. But the constable slept on, and no
one knew the fate that had befallen her 'till
Mr. Short, the surgeon, passing the house,
was attracted to the spot where she had fallen,
by a moan, and the sight of a white object
lying beneath the window.</p>

<p>A loud ringing of the bell, and knocking at
the door, soon roused the inhabitants of the
house, and the mangled form of Mrs. Hazleton
was carried in and stretched upon a bed.
She was not dead; and although almost every
bone was broken, except the skull, and the
terrible injuries she had received precluded
all possibility of recovery, she regained her
senses before three o'clock of the same day,
and continued to linger for somewhat more
than a fortnight in agonies both of mind and
body, too terrible to be described. With the
rapid, though gradual weakening of the corporeal
frame, the powers of the mind became
enfeebled&mdash;the vigorous resolution failed&mdash;the
self-command abandoned her. Half an
hour's death she could have borne with stoical
firmness, but a fortnight's was too much.
The thoughts she could shut out in vigorous
health, forced themselves upon her as she lay
there like a crushed worm, and the tortures
of hell got hold upon her, long before the
spirit departed. Yet a sparkle of the old
spirit showed itself even to her last hour.
That she was conscious of an eternity, that
she was convinced of after judgment, of the
reward of good, and of the punishment of
evil, that she believed in a God, a hell, a
heaven, there can be no doubt&mdash;indeed her
words more than once implied it&mdash;and the
anguish of mind under which she seemed to
writhe proved it. But yet, she refused all
religious consolation; expressed no penitence:
no sorrow for what she had done, and scoffed
at the surgeon when he hinted that repentance
might avail her even then. It seemed that,
as with the earthly future, she had made up
her mind at once, when first detected, to
meet her fate boldly; so with the judgment
of the immortal future, she was resolute to
encounter it unbending. When urged, nearly
at her last hour, to show some repentance,
she replied in the weak and faltering voice
of death, but in as determined a tone as ever,
"It is all trash. An hour's repentance could
do no good even if I could repent. But I do
not. Nobody does repent. They regret their
failure, are terrified by their punishment; but
they and I would do exactly the same again
if we hoped for success and impunity. Talk
to me no more of it. I do not wish to think
of hell till it has hold upon me, if that should
ever be."</p>

<p>She said no more from that moment forward,
and in about an hour after, her spirit
went to meet the fate she had so boldly
dared.</p>

<p>But few persons remain to be noticed in
this concluding chapter, and with regard to
their after history, the imagination of the
reader might perhaps be left to deal, without
further information. A few words, however,
may be said, merely to give a clue to their
after fate.</p>

<p>The prosecution of Mr. Shanks, the attorney,
was carried on but languidly, and it is
certain that he was not convicted of the
higher offence of forgery. On some charge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
however, it would seem he was sentenced to
two years imprisonment, and the last that is
heard of him, shows him blacking shoes at
the inn in Carrington, then a very old man,
in the reign of George the First.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Hastings never recovered his
senses, nor did he seem to have any recollection
of the horrible events with which his
earthly history may be said to have closed;
but his life was not far extended. For about
six months he continued in the same lamentable
state in which we have last depicted him,
sometimes singing, sometimes laughing, and
sometimes absorbed in deep melancholy. At
the end of that period, another paralytic
stroke left him in a state of complete fatuity,
from which in two years he was relieved by
death.</p>

<p>If the reader will look into the annals of
the reign of Queen Anne he will find frequent
mention in the campaigns of Marlborough and
Eugene, of a Major, a Colonel, and a General
Marlow. They were all the same person;
and they will find that officer often reported
as severely wounded. I cannot trace his history
much farther; but the genealogies of
those times show, that in 1712, one Earl of
Launceston died at the age of eighty-seven,
and was succeeded by the eighth Earl, who
only survived three years, and the title with
him became extinct, as it is particularly
marked that he died unmarried. As this last
of the race is distinguished by the title of
Lieutenant-General, the Earl of Launceston,
there can be no doubt that this was the lover
and promised husband of poor Emily Hastings.</p>

<p>It is a sad tale, and rarely perhaps has any
such tragedy darkened the page of domestic
history in England. A whole family were
swept away, and most of those connected
with them, in a very short space of time;
but it is not the number of deaths within that
period that gives its gloominess to the page&mdash;for
every domestic history is little but a record
of deaths&mdash;but the circumstances. Youth,
beauty, virtue, gentleness, kindness, honor,
integrity, punctilious rectitude: reason, energy,
wisdom, sometimes, nay often, have no
effect as a screen, from misfortune, sorrow,
and death. Were this world all, what a
frightful chaos would human life be. But
the very sorrows and adversities of the good,
prove that there is a life beyond, where all
will be made even.</p>

<p class="center">THE END.</p>




<p class="center">From Bentley's Miscellany.</p>

<h2>CALCUTTA.</h2>


<p>There are in Calcutta four colleges established
by Government, besides numerous
other institutions for the diffusion of
learning. Education, indeed, is very general
in the metropolis, and there are but few,
even among the natives, making any pretensions
to respectability, who have not some
acquaintance with European literature. I
have heard as pure English spoken by Hindoos
in Calcutta as by men of rank in London,
and pieces from our poets recited by a
lad of color with a correctness of diction and
eloquence that would have done credit to
any of our youth at home. Go where you
will in Calcutta, enter the narrowest streets
and the most obscure alleys, and you will
find pedagogues engaged in teaching Pinnock
or Goldsmith to the children, and ragged
urchins of three or four years old shouting in
concert, B-l-a, bla; c-l-a, cla. And then turn
your eyes in an opposite direction; look at
the wealthy and the noble of mature age, enter
their houses, and what will you see and
hear? You will see their dwellings furnished
and their tables laid out in <i>English</i> style;
you will see them possessed of libraries composed
of the best works of the most approved
<i>English</i> authors; you will see <i>English</i> newspapers
regularly filed; you will see them
corresponding in <i>English</i> with their friends
and connections; and you will hear them
conversing on the topics of the day or their
own private affairs in the <i>English</i> tongue.
A person who had never travelled beyond
the metropolis would be apt, on seeing all
this, to exclaim, "The people will soon be
thoroughly Anglicised!" But it is all confined
to Calcutta, and even there is rather,
perhaps, the result of a wish to outshine, than
of a desire to improve.</p>

<p>A Mechanics' Institute was a few years
since established in Calcutta. Institutions of
this kind are particularly required in India,
where the national systems of agriculture,
commerce, mechanics, science, literature, and
philosophy are so wretched; where prejudice
and superstition impede improvement,
and sloth and ignorance have had so long a
reign. It is surely the duty of those who
seek affluence in that country to encourage
them, and thus endeavor to benefit the land
from whose resources they expect to gain it.
But, in spite of the old adage, "What's in a
name?" the fate of this institution proved
that there is something very important in the
nomenclature of a thing. The title "Mechanic"
is in a manner <i>despised</i> by the European
community of Calcutta and their Euratian
brethren; and so long as the Institute
continued to bear the title which distinguished
it as dedicated to such, notwithstanding
the plainness with which it exhibited its
claims to support as an institution calculated
to disseminate a correct and practical knowledge
of science, and a familiar acquaintance
with the fine arts throughout the empire, and
by the improvements such a knowledge
would induce ulteriorly to promote the interests
of all connected with India; notwithstanding
appeals to the press, public lectures
and private solicitations; notwithstanding
the most brilliant speeches of the most eloquent
orators (among whom may be particularly
mentioned Mr. George Thompson),
it languished for want of support, gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>
decayed, and seemed about to yield up the
ghost. It was at last suggested, that though
the expedients above alluded to had failed to
stay the progress of disease, or invigorate the
system, one, powerful as a galvanic battery,
yet remained to be tried, a new nomenclature.
It was proposed that the vulgar title
of "Mechanics' Institute" should be thrown
off, and the elegant and euphonious one of
"The Lyceum" adopted. This was done;
and wonderful was the effect. The young
and tender tree revived in an instant, refreshing
streams of cash were poured in
abundance upon its roots; the very nobles of
the land came forward to tend it, and now it
flourishes and blooms, and promises ere long
to produce a rich abundance of fruit. Still it
is in reality the same as before in all but its
name.</p>

<p>I have alluded to Mr. George Thompson.
His arrival in India in 1843 was greeted by
all classes of the community with joy. All
had heard of his eloquence and his ability, of
the interest he had exhibited in the affairs of,
and his design in visiting, India, and therefore
hailed him as the champion of her interests.
Hindoo and Mussulman flocked eagerly
around the standard he raised as a patriot
leader, listened to his addresses, and, as he
enlarged on their rights and wrongs (so far
as he knew them) felt discontent, hatred to
the rulers of their country, and bold resolutions
to free it from their tyranny, rising
within them. The press lauded and flattered
him; invitations overwhelmed him; patriotic
societies rose from nonentity at his presence;
and his person and character were themes of
inquiry and constant disquisition; imitative
would-be orators sprang up in multitudes,
and poured forth torrents of anger and abuse
against Government, and all was excitement,
all radicalism. Suddenly the man on whom the
eyes of the people were fixed as their instructor
and guide left the metropolis, and when he
again appeared in it, did so in the character
of ambassador from the Great Mogul. With
what abuse he then met, let the periodicals
of the day testify. "Where now," it was
asked, "are his magniloquent professions of
philanthropy, his self-devotedness, and his
zeal in the cause of India?"</p>

<p>In India, as in England, the public appetite
for the drama seems to have been satiated.
There is a very elegant theatre in Calcutta,
but it is now closed. It languished for
want of support, though several talented performers
were attached to it. Mrs. Leach, its
founder and greatest ornament, was an exquisite
actress. A Miss Cowley and a Miss
Baxter, too, were both superior and elegant
actresses. The latter preserved the theatre
to the community on a former occasion,
when it seemed about to fall. A circumstance,
as true as it is laughable, connected
with this theatre, occurred in 1841. Two
ladies, engaged in England for it, and sent
out, were actually entered among the "imports
manifest" for the port of Calcutta, as
goods consigned to the manager of the playhouse!</p>

<p>The newspaper is as necessary an adjunct
to the breakfast table in Calcutta as it is in
London. The military man looks eagerly for
accounts from the north-west; turns to the
lists of promotions and staff appointments,
and forgets not to cast his eye at the obituary;
the civilian searches for the advertisements
which announce fresh arrivals of
horses from Persia, Burmah, and Arabia;
spinsters' and oilmen's stores from England;
and wines and fruits from France; just glancing
at the drafts of laws about to be enacted,
and conning over the programme of the next
races; and the merchant studies the accounts
relative to indigo, sugar, and saltpetre. But
the greatest excitement prevails when the
mail from England is due. How eagerly is
it looked for, and when it arrives, how are
its contents scanned and analyzed!</p>

<p>There are six English newspapers published
in Calcutta and its neighborhood. The
editors are all men of experience and talent,
who know how to suit the appetites of their
customers. An English reader, however,
taking up one of our Indian newspapers,
would think it a very dull affair, for he would
find one-third of it editorial and local news,
another third advertisements, and the remainder,
extracts from the London magazines.
Now this is what just suits the Anglo-Indians.
The advertisements tell them what to do with
their money, the residue informs them of
what is going on, and gives them the very
pith of literature without putting them to
the trouble of cutting it from the crust.</p>

<p>The Indian press has been stigmatized in
England as a "licentious," a "rascally," and
an "unscrupulous" one. This is very far
from being the case. It has its faults, but
they are not of such a kind. Indeed, it seems
to me, that in point of purity, honesty, and
morality, it may challenge comparison with
the press of Great Britain itself, and most
decidedly it possesses a powerful influence
with the executive. It has been the means,
within the last few years, of causing the abolition
of lotteries, the appointment of deputy
magistrates, and many other measures tending
to the moralization and welfare of the
country. It scans and fearlessly criticises the
acts of Government; it shows a spirit of active
benevolence in pleading the cause of the
injured, to whatever class they may belong;
and proves itself impartially just.</p>

<p>In addition to newspapers several magazines
and other periodicals are published in Calcutta.
The whole of the periodical publications
amount in number to forty. A Quarterly
Review has lately been added to those,
and also a Magazine, the intended publication
of which, and its character, were announced
in so curious a manner, that I shall copy the
advertisement at full length for the benefit of
the reader: "In the press, and will be published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
on the 1st of July, and continued monthly,
a new periodical, entitled, The British India
Magazine, and Daily and Monthly Treasury,
a most useful Writing and Reading Table
Manual of Reference, Memoranda, Expenditure,
and Literature, to which is added a Precis
of the News of the past month, Political,
Fashionable, Social, Commercial, Humorous,
and Scientific. It is equally adapted for ladies
in general, as for Gentlemen of the Civil,
Military, and Uncovenanted Services, Members
of the Legal and Medical Professions,
Merchants, Indigo and Sugar Planters, and
Planters' Assistants, Captains and Officers of
Ships, Clerks in Mercantile Houses, &amp;c., or
in fact, for all Persons by whom due order
and regularity in the expenditure of their
Time and Income is considered an object
worthy of notice. It is compiled upon a
method perfectly novel in the annals of the
Press, be it American, Asiatic, or European,
and may be had (per dak) in all parts of British
India."</p>

<p>There, dear reader, match that in Europe,
if you can! "Why this is a real Vade Mecum;
and, mark you! a <i>most</i> useful one&mdash;one
equally adapted for ladies in general as
for gentlemen, or in fact for <i>all</i> persons."
Doubtless it will have a prodigious circulation
as soon as its merits are fully known. I have
not met with any one who has read it.</p>

<p>Books published in India, whatever may be
their nature, seldom repay the cost of print
and paper. Even the Calcutta newspapers
have between them all no more than three or
four thousand subscribers, and yet our countrymen
there read a great deal. But the
works which have emanated from the pens
of Anglo-Indian writers have in general been
so dull and spiritless, that the community has
learned to regard all such with indifference;
and as the booksellers regularly supply the
newest and best European productions, these
inferior viands are almost entirely neglected.
An annual has once or twice been published,
but did not meet with sufficient patronage to
allow of its being regularly continued.</p>

<p>The police of India has always been inefficient.
Robberies committed under the very
noses of the watchmen are common. When
they should be on the look-out, they are found
sleeping, and when they are awake are careless
and negligent. The worst of them in all
India are to be found in its great metropolis;
in Calcutta, indeed, they seem to possess no
honesty or fidelity, and often turn out greater
rogues than those they bring to justice. Policemen
in the confidence of the European
authorities have before now been discovered
to be at the head of parties of Thugs, to whom
they have thus had the means of communicating
all necessary intelligence.</p>

<p>The native <i>employ&eacute;s</i> in our courts of justice
are equally corrupt. Every Hindoo and Mussulman
who has occasion to resort to these
courts, takes with him a bribe, knowing that
unless he does so, it will be all but impossible
for him to obtain a fair and impartial hearing.
The <i>omlah</i> who should decline a bribe, would
be accounted a fool by his fellow officials.
And so some of them make fortunes; <i>e. g.</i>,
a <i>sheristader</i> at one of our civil courts, who
had been only ten years in that office, on a
salary of one hundred rupees a month, and
with no other income save a trifling share in
a small patrimonial estate, managed, a short
time back, to purchase landed property to the
value of fifty thousand rupees.</p>

<p>Enter a criminal court, whether the deponent
swear by the water of the Ganges held
in his hand, or by the Koran laid on his head,
or by licking off salt from a sword, or by
placing a milk-jug on his back, or any other
mode practised among them, you will find
that perjury and the grossest exaggeration are
with him far more common than truth. If
he has received a light box or a gentle kick,
he will make oath that he has been half murdered;
and if he has been robbed of an article
worth twenty rupees, will swear its value
was a hundred!</p>

<p>A judge has seldom a more conflicting
mass of evidence before him on which to decide
the merits of a case, than he has who
seeks by investigating the principles and conduct
of this people to form an opinion of their
general character. It seems to me that, as a
nation, there is no other people so profligate,
so licentious and avaricious, so addicted to
lying, dishonesty, procrastination, gossip, and
perpetual egotism, so servile, so litigious, and
so filthy; and no other so barren of nearly
every good quality. Their code of morality,
to judge from their practice, is a huge mass
of every thing bad, mingled with a few almost
imperceptible grains of some things that are
good.</p>

<p>In India, when we look around us and see
the fertility of the earth, the abundance of
grain and fruit it produces, we feel astonished
that those engaged in agriculture should
be, as they really are, almost destitute of a
bare subsistence. The Irish peasantry are
rarely so badly off as those of Hindostan. Inquiry
shows us this is the result of a system
prevailing throughout the country, the oppression
of the ryots by the Zemindars. Yes,
it is not the taxes, which are comparatively
light, that cause this evil, but the exactions
of the rich natives from the poor ones. The
peasantry have no money, they require advances
to enable them to cultivate, these are
granted to them at the most exorbitant rate
of usury by the landlords, and as the one
party never gets out of debt, so the other
never ceases its extortions.</p>

<p>Thus the poor are kept poor. The personal
property of a peasant seldom exceeds three
or four shillings in value. His wardrobe consists
of a piece of coarse cloth, just large
enough to gird round his body, a similar piece
thrown across the shoulders, and a skull-cap
or turban, made of long strips of the same
material. And as for his household goods, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>
few drinking vessels, an earthen jar, an iron
plate, and a rickety bedstead comprise in general
the whole.</p>

<p>Very little attention is paid in Calcutta, or
anywhere else in India, to home politics. Indeed
they are never discussed at table. Let
a man have been ever so violent a Tory or
zealous a Whig, six months in India will generally
find him, so far as his discourse can
testify, neuter. One reason of this is, that
if he should attempt to introduce political
subjects in conversation, he would not be
listened to. It is only when India and Indian
interests are concerned, that even a powerful
debate in the House meets with the slightest
attention. Theatricals, races, retiring
funds, public characters, civil and military
appointments, these, and such like subjects,
form the ordinary topics of discourse. And
you may always know when a man has lived
any time in India, for a little of the Eastern
spice is sure to be found in all his conversation.
He cannot conceal it.</p>

<p>An anecdote was one day related to me,
which exemplifies the sad condition of those
habitual consumers of opium, many of whom
are to be found among the natives. A Hindoo
gentleman, who was accustomed to indulge
in it, being about to remove to a distant
and almost uninhabited province, in
which he knew it would be difficult to procure
opium, laid in a large quantity of it to
take with him, and made arrangements for
having more regularly forwarded. Soon after
his arrival at his destination, one of his
servants decamped, robbing him of a large
amount in money, and a variety of other articles,
among which his entire stock of opium
was included. The period at which he expected
his first auxiliary supply was yet distant;
but he immediately sent for a quantity
to his agent; as this however did not arrive
for a considerable time, he was at a loss for his
usual stimulant, pined away in a few days for
want of it, and in less than a fortnight died.</p>

<p>There are numerous low chop-houses and
taverns in Calcutta, to which our poorer
countrymen resort, and these are the nests of
profligacy and licentiousness. Impositions
too, of the grossest and most atrocious nature,
are practised by the proprietors of some,
on those who frequent them.</p>

<p>While in the country I made one of a small
party at an annual festival, given by the native
officers of a Government establishment
in the neighborhood. The worthy <i>baboo</i>,
who was at the head of the concern, had resolved
to prepare for the half-dozen Europeans
whom he expected to honor the feast
with their presence, two things, of which
most <i>Feringees</i> approve, viz., a <i>pillau</i> and a
bottle of brandy. Being a Hindoo, however,
he had substituted pieces of cheese for meat
in the stew, thinking, no doubt, that it would
make but little difference to us. Of course,
we could not touch it; but we did not mind
its loss, as the <i>aqua vit&aelig;</i> yet remained. The
master of the ceremonies, however, had forgotten
to provide a corkscrew. In this emergency
one of our number offered to save the
trouble of sending for one by knocking off the
neck of the bottle with the butt of his riding-whip.
This he attempted, but, missing his
aim, broke the bottle and spilt all the liquor.
It was too late to send for more, and, as we
did not find any thing else to our relish, we
came away after all, much to the vexation of
our host, without having tasted either bit or
drop.</p>

<p>How different in the effects they produce
on the heart, and in the sentiments they
awaken, are the various seasons of the year
in India to the same in our native land. How
sweetly speaks the changing year to the minds
of the unsophisticated and innocent of England's
children! Are their hearts oppressed
by misfortune? with the spring they revive,
and, like nature, shake off the torpor into
which, overcome by their sorrows, they were
sinking, while Hope, with the flowers, buds
once more sweetly forth. The summer sun
brings with it cheerfulness and joy; hearts
and hopes together expand; they watch, with
anxiety and pleasure, the ripening of the
dainty fruits, which promise in autumn to
replenish their board; they sport in the new-mown
and perfume-exhaling fields; they
bathe in the clear, unruffled stream, and feel
convinced that earth has not yet been despoiled
by sin of all its charms, that there are
pursuits at once pure and delightful, that man
is not made to mourn but to rejoice, and that
in nature, the beneficence of the Deity is demonstrated.
Even stern winter has something
pleasant in his countenance, and is kind
enough to make them sometimes long for his
return while enjoying the smiles of seasons
more congenial; for they with rapture anticipate
a meeting with the friends whom he assembles;
the sweet congratulations, the merry
tales, the laughter-exciting songs, which
will then burst forth from affectionate and
happy hearts, and make the blazing hearth a
scene of unalloyed ecstasy. But it is not
thus in the arid and joyless East. We watch
the approach of spring with apprehension,
for it brings in its train disease and death;
we shrink, and seek in the mountains a refuge
from the fiery temper and scorching
breath of summer; autumn's gloom makes all
nature distasteful to us; and winter, though
it affords a temporary relief from pain, is totally
unproductive of pleasure.</p>

<p>During the early part of his Indian career,
the military officer in the Hon. Company's
service, finds that nearly all the labor, though
but a small share of the honor or profit, of
sustaining our hardly-earned reputation, falls
on his shoulders, and on those of his comrades.
The honor is almost entirely engrossed,
and what little falls to his share is entirely
eclipsed by that allotted to his superiors
in rank; the income he derives from his position
is insignificant when compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
that of his contemporaries of the civil service.
The civilian, it is well known, has a
far better chance of making a fortune in
twenty, than the soldier in forty years. From
the period of his arrival in the country, until
after having studied and passed an examination
in the Hindee and Persian languages, he
is reported qualified for the public service,
and receives an appointment; the former enjoys
a salary superior to that which is paid to
the latter as the allowance of an ensign or
cornet. The military man cannot obtain any
staff employ which affords an augmentation
of pay until he shows himself well qualified
in the native languages. Then again, the
civilian, if he manifest any ability, may, in
ten or twelve years, rise to a high and lucrative
post; whereas the poor scarlet-coated
hero, unless he have the good fortune to get
a quarter-master, or interpreter-ship, or to be
appointed an aid-de-camp, has to vegetate on
two hundred rupees <i>per mensem</i>, for some
thirteen or fourteen years, when he may receive
an additional hundred with a lieutenancy.
Supposing him, however, to have
obtained a good snug berth, his income will
be a trifle when compared with that of the
civilian, who escaped from the school-bench
at the same time as himself, while he is always
exposed to changes and inconveniences
of which the latter knows nothing. But the
sub has one comfort amidst all this: "In due
time," thinks he, "I may hope to be a general."</p>

<p class="center">"Hope told a flattering tale,"</p>

<p>is, however, the exclamation of many an old
veteran in his declining years; and still oftener
is it the sorrowful evidence of those who
live to mourn over the early extinction of
even the most brilliant prospects entertained
by youthful relatives, who have fallen a prey
to the inclemencies of a climate which their
constitutions were unfitted to sustain.</p>

<p>But, after all, fortunes are not now-a-days
made, even by the most <i>fortunate</i> of our
countrymen, so easily as they were some fifty,
or even thirty years ago. Nor are we
even worthy of comparison with the natives
of India in this respect. On the station of
Cawnpore are now residing the two sons of
a man who, report says, was nothing more
than a common <i>bobarchee</i>, or cook, in the
household of the late king of Lucknow, but
who, by his skill in spicing wine, and manufacturing
peculiarly delicious draughts of an
inebriating nature, attracted the notice of his
majesty, a man of licentious and depraved
habits, accounted an orthodox Mussulman,
but exceedingly fond of the bottle. The
monarch having tasted a sample of his <i>bobarchee's</i>
elixir, to reward his skill and encourage
his merit, presented him with a situation
near the royal person, and as, while holding
this appointment, he continued to afford him
the highest satisfaction, advanced him step
by step, and at length, on a vacancy occurring,
as a mark of his especial favor, gave
him the post of prime minister.</p>

<p>This office he continued to hold until his
master's decease; and in the mean time obtained
so great an influence with the monarch
that his majesty is said to have been little better
than an automaton, whose movements
were regulated by his hand. His chief object,
like that of all his countrymen, being to
amass wealth, he tyrannized over the people,
and left no stone unturned beneath which he
deemed it possible that wealth might be discovered.
One mode of "raising the wind"
was frequently practised by him. A merchant,
or other rich man, having just completed
the erection of a large and magnificent
abode, in which to spend luxuriously the remainder
of his days, the minister would forward
to him an official dispatch, intimating
that the spot on which he had built must be
immediately cleared for state purposes, and
that no compensation would be given him.</p>

<p>Astonished and perplexed at such a notice
from an authority it was useless to dispute,
the unfortunate victim would, perhaps, endeavor,
by pointing out some other eligible
spot for the presumed purpose of the government,
and offering a <i>muzzur</i> of, it may be,
ten thousand rupees, to avert the threatened
calamity; but to no purpose, for the wily
man, who had risen from the office of a slave
to the highest post under the crown, would
at first accept of no terms. The petitioner,
therefore, turned away in despair, and went
back to his house, to which, after a few
hours, an emissary of the minister would follow
him with a message, intimating that
should any thing worthy his acceptance be
presented to the premier in his private character,
he would use his influence with the
king to have the order revoked. Elated with
this apparent chance of escape, the unlucky
individual thus destined to be "squeezed"
would, perhaps, offer a sum larger than the
minister had anticipated. But even this was
sure to be indignantly refused, and not until
the victim had been visited over and over
again, and no hope of any larger offer remained,
would the bribe be accepted. Thus, and
by a variety of other means, the <i>bobarchee</i>
gathered a vast amount of wealth. On the
death of the monarch who had so blindly favored
and elevated him, he fared but poorly,
however, for the new king threw him into
prison. It was now <i>his</i> turn to bribe, and a
timely present of fifty lacs of rupees to an influential
person procured his release. Even
then he had an immense fortune remaining,
and thinking it best to secure both his person
and his money against further annoyance
and depredation, he left Lucknow, and settled
down in our dominions.</p>

<p>While residing in Calcutta, I was brought
into frequent contact with individuals belonging
to the Eurasian or half-caste population,
and as comparatively little is known of this
class of people in England, I shall here make
a few remarks on their character.</p>

<p>They are generally the descendants of European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
fathers by native mothers. The great
majority of them are of Portuguese, many of
British, and some of French extraction. Altogether
they form a community by themselves,
as distinct from the European society
around them as from the Hindoos and Mahommedans.
They do not travel; here they
live and multiply, marrying generally among
themselves. As they are daily increasing in
number, they will, of course, in time become
so numerous as to consider themselves a nation,
and to demand a place in history. Should
such, however, be the case, I do not think
they will occupy a very high position in the
scale of nations. Great talent (I will not
mention <i>genius</i>) and sterling abilities seem
very scarce amongst them. They devote no
attention to the cultivation of the arts, they
manifest no zeal in the pursuits of science, no
independence, no brotherly feeling towards
each other. The females, at best, receive
but a superficial education, it generally extending
only to reading, writing, and the mechanical
performance of music, dancing, and
ornamental needlework, and in none of these
do they show any extraordinary skill. As
girls they are flirts and coquettes; as women
they are vain, idle, and slovenly.</p>

<p>Let me be candid, however. I have found
among the Eurasians men possessing a versatility
of talent that would do honor to any of
our own countrymen, and females adorned
with every grace and accomplishment. But
such characters are very, <i>very</i> scarce.</p>

<h2>REVOLUTIONS OF RUSSIA</h2>

<p class="center">THE ACCESSION OF NICHOLAS I., 1825.</p>


<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF ALEXANDER DUMAS.</p>

<p>The death of the Emperor Alexander placed
the inhabitants of his empire in mourning;
for the grief and loyalty of the lower
classes were sincere, and their attachment to
his person almost idolatrous in its character.
The public feeling was increased by the prospect
of the reign of an unpopular sovereign
afflicted with mental malady, and devoid of
courtesy.</p>

<p>As for the Grand-duke Nicholas, no one
thought of him, but the Russian people
dreaded the accession of Constantine, whom
they considered their sovereign in right of
his primogeniture. In no country in the
world has this natural law been so repeatedly
broken. Every person in Russia was aware
that the heir-presumptive had purchased his
marriage with a Polish lady, the object of his ardent
affections, by the resignation of his claims
to the succession, but that he would abide by
that act seemed a conjecture too improbable
to be entertained by any one. Constantine
was nevertheless sincere when he abandoned
his rights, and he hastened to assure his next
brother that he was so, by his youngest brother
the Grand-duke Michael, through whom
he forwarded a letter confirming his resignation
of the throne, and acknowledging his
next brother as his sovereign. The courier
from St. Petersburg crossed the Grand-duke
Michael, and brought letters from Nicholas
acknowledging Constantine as his Emperor,
and urging him to ascend the throne. The
wife of Constantine joined her entreaties to
those of the next heir, and with rare devotion
offered to resign her consort rather than that
should give up the empire for her. Constantine,
over whose mental agonies the
soothing influence of the fair Pole possessed
a magical power, continued firm in his resolution
to remain in the condition of a subject,
and he adhered to the determination he had
expressed in the important document of which
the Grand-duke Michael was the bearer, and
which is here subjoined:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;I received
yesterday, with feelings of profound sorrow,
intelligence of the death of our adored sovereign,
and my benefactor, the Emperor Alexander.
In hastening to assure you of the
painful feelings this misfortune has excited
in my mind, I do only my duty in announcing
to you that I have forwarded to her Imperial Majesty,
our august mother, a letter,
in which I declare, that in consequence of
the rescript I obtained from the late Emperor,
bearing date February the 2d, 1822,
permitting my renunciation of the throne, it
is now my unalterable determination to give
up to you all my rights to the Empire of Russia.
I entreated, at the same time, our beloved
mother, to make this declaration public,
that the same may be put into immediate
execution. After this declaration, I regard
it as a sacred duty to beseech your Imperial
Majesty to receive the first from me, the oath
of fidelity and submission, and to permit me
to say that I do not aspire to any other title
or dignity than that of Czarowitz, with which
my august father deigned to honor my services.
My solo happiness, hereafter, will
consist in giving your Imperial Majesty continual
proofs of my unbounded devotion and
respect for your person, of which thirty years
of constant and zealous service to the Emperors,
my father and brother, are the pledge,
in which sentiments I wish to serve your Imperial
Majesty, and your successors, until the
end of my life, in my present situation and
functions.</p>

<p>"I am, with the most profound respect,</p>
<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Constantine</span>."</p>

<p>Upon the receipt of the dispatches which
followed this letter, the Grand-duke, called
to reign over a vast Empire, by the repeated
abdication of his brother of the rights of primogeniture,
no longer hesitated,&mdash;he published
the former correspondence between
the Emperor Alexander and the Grand-duke
Constantine, with the document already
quoted upon the 25th of December, 1825, and
fixed the morrow for his recognition as their
sovereign by his people.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of St. Petersburg, relieved
from their dread of a second Paul by the abdication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
of the heir-presumptive, began to
reflect with hope upon the promise which
the talents and pure moral character of their
new sovereign afforded them. The handsomest
and bravest man in his dominions, his
fine person attracted attention, and his reserved
manners excited awe. His grave
carriage, his downcast look, only raised to
penetrate to the soul the man who ventured
to observe him, with a glance which compelled
him to know and reverence his master&mdash;his
haughty manner of interrogation, so
unlike the suavity of Alexander, or the bluntness
of Constantine, had isolated him from
the rest of the imperial family, and centred
him in the bosom of his own domestic circle.
The Russian people, feeling their need of a
guide, at once comprehended that the cold
dignity of this prince concealed an indomitable
will, and that, if they themselves had not
chosen their new sovereign, God had considered
their need, and given to the Russians,
who were at once too polished and too barbarous,
a man who would grasp the sceptre
in an iron hand covered with a velvet glove.</p>

<p>The morrow, though considered as a day
of joy and festivity, was preceded by some
rumors that, like the breath of an approaching
tempest, gave warning that some great
national crisis was at hand. It was whispered
in the evening of the 25th that the abdication
of the Czarowitz was a forgery, and
that Constantine, then exercising the authority
of Viceroy of Poland, was on full march
for St. Petersburg with an army to claim the
empire as his birthright. In addition to this
startling rumor, it was said that several regiments,
and among them that of Moscow, had
determined to take the oath to no Russian
prince but Constantine; and the words, "Let
Nicholas live, but let Constantine reign,"
were heard at intervals in the streets as an
intimation of the state of the military pulse.</p>

<p>In fact, the conspiracy which had disturbed
the last days of the Emperor Alexander was
about to raise its head, and seize upon the
Great-Duke Constantine's name as its rallying
point. This Prince, who had passed his
life with the army, was beloved by the soldiers,
and the conspirators, who understood
little of the character of their new sovereign,
supposed the revolt of the regiments stationed
in St. Petersburg would compel him to resign
his recently acquired rights. They would
then summon Constantine to receive the empire,
and with it the constitution they had
prepared. If he refused to accept it, they intended
to imprison him and the rest of the
imperial family. They would then establish
a republic, an oligarchy in which the despotism
of the many would replace the despotism
of one. Such was the design of a party composed
of military aristocrats, who, bolder than
the murderers of Paul, dared, by open force
and secret fraud, to contest the throne of
Russia with its new sovereign. The soldiers,
devoted to Constantine, they designed to
make their blind instruments in a conspiracy
of which that Prince was not the real object,
but their own aggrandisement.</p>

<p>Faithful to their plans, the Prince Stah&mdash;&mdash; and
the two Bes&mdash;&mdash; went to the barracks of
the 2d, 3d, 5th and 6th companies of the Regiment
of Moscow, whom they knew to be devoted
to Constantine. The Prince then informed
these men that they were deceived
respecting the abdication of the Czarowitz,
and pointed out Alexander B&mdash;&mdash; to their attention,
whom he affirmed had been sent from
Warsaw to warn them against taking the
oath to the Grand-duke Nicholas. The address
of Alexander B&mdash;&mdash;, confirming this
astounding communication, excited a great
sensation among the troops, of which the
Prince took advantage by ordering them to
load and present. At that instant the Aide-de-camp
Verighny and Major-General Fredericks,
who commanded the grenadiers, having
the charge of the flag, came to invite the
officers to visit the colonel of the regiment.
Prince Stah&mdash;&mdash;, who believed the favorable
moment was come, ordered the soldiers to
repulse the grenadiers with <i>coup-de-crosses</i>,
and to take away their flag, at the same time
throwing himself upon Major-General Fredericks,
whom B&mdash;&mdash;, on the other side, menaced
with a pistol, with the stock of which
he felled him to the earth; then, turning
upon Major Schenshine, commander of the
brigade, who ran to the assistance of his colleague,
he knocked him down in a moment,
and flinging himself among the grenadiers, successively
wounded Grenadier Krassoffski,
Colonel Khavosschinski, and Subaltern Moussieff;
and cutting his way to the flag, seized
and elevated it with a loud and triumphant
hurrah. To that cry, and to the sight of the
blood so boldly shed to win the flag, the
greater part of the regiment replied, "Long
live Constantine! down with Nicholas!"
Prince Stah&mdash;&mdash;, followed by four hundred
men whom he had seduced from their duty,
then marched, with drums beating, to the
Admiralty quarter.</p>

<p>At the gate of the winter palace, the aide-de-camp,
the bearer of the news of the revolt,
encountered another officer, who brought
tidings from the barracks of the grenadier
corps of equally alarming import. When
that regiment were preparing to take the
oath of fidelity to the Emperor Nicholas, the
sub-lieutenant Kojenikoff threw himself before
the advanced-guard, exclaiming, "It is
not to the Grand-duke Nicholas we ought to
make oath, but to the Emperor Constantine."
He was told that the Czarowitz had abdicated
in his next brother's favor. "It is false,"
was his reply; "totally false; he is on the
march for St. Petersburg to reward the
faithful and punish the guilty."</p>

<p>The regiment, notwithstanding these outcries,
continued its march, took the oath of
allegiance to the new sovereign, and returned
into quarters, without showing any disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
resembling revolt. At dinner-time Lieutenant
Suthoff, who had taken the pledge of
obedience with the rest, entered at that moment,
and addressed himself to his own company
in a manner calculated to excite their
attention: "My friends, we were wrong to
obey the order; the other regiments are in
open revolt; they have refused to take the
oath, and are at this moment in the Place of
the Senate;&mdash;put on your uniforms, arm,
come on, and follow me; I have your
pay in my pocket, which I am ready to distribute
without waiting for the ceremony of
an order."</p>

<p>"But is what you say quite true?" cried
many voices.</p>

<p>"Stay, here is Lieutenant Panoff,&mdash;like
myself, one of your best friends,&mdash;ask him."</p>

<p>"My friends," remarked Panoff, anticipating
their question, "you all know that Constantine
is your only lawful emperor, and
that they wish to dethrone him."</p>

<p>"Live Constantine!" replied the soldiers.</p>

<p>"Live Nicholas!" exclaimed Colonel Sturler,
the commander of the regiment, throwing
himself courageously into the hall. "They
are deceiving you, my friends; the Czarowitz
has really abdicated, and you have now
no other emperor than the Grand-duke Nicholas.
Live Nicholas!"</p>

<p>"Live Constantine!" responded the soldiers.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, soldiers; you are
about to take a fatal step; you are deceived,"
again shouted the colonel.</p>

<p>"Comrades, do not abandon me; follow
me," cried Panoff; "let those who are for
Constantine, unite with me in the cry, 'Long
live Constantine!'"</p>

<p>More than three parts of those present
joined in the cry of "Long live Constantine!"</p>

<p>"To the Admiralty! to the Admiralty!"
said Panoff, drawing his sword; "follow me,
soldiers, follow me."</p>

<p>With a wild hurrah two hundred soldiers
followed their leader to the place he indicated,
whither, though by a different route, the
insurgent portion of the Regiment of Moscow
had already preceded them.</p>

<p>Milarodowich, the military governor of St.
Petersburg, a cavalry general, whose splendid
charges on the field had gained him the
appellation of the Russian Murat, was by this
time at the palace, to communicate to his
new sovereign the dispositions he had made
for the defence of his throne and the capital.
He had directed the troops upon whose fidelity
he thought he could rely, to march to the
winter palace. The first battalion of the
regiment Preobrajenski, three regiments of
the guard Paulowski, and the battalion of the
Sapper and Miners, were those he considered
fit for this important service.</p>

<p>The emperor saw then that the mutiny
was more general than he anticipated; he
therefore sent by Major-general Meidhart, to
carry orders to the Semenowski guard to repress
the mutineers, and to the horse-guards,
to hold themselves in readiness to mount.
He went down himself to the corps of chief
guards of the winter palace, where the regiment
of Finland guards were at that time on
duty, and ordered them to load their muskets
and invest the principal avenues of the
palace. At that very moment tumultuous
sounds interrupted the voice of the sovereign,
occasioned by the approach of the third and
sixth companies of the Regiment of Moscow,
headed by Prince Stah&mdash;&mdash;, and the two
B&mdash;&mdash;, with the captured flag proudly displayed
to the wind, and drums beating, to
the ominous cry of "Long live Constantine!
Down with Nicholas!" The rebel troops debouched
on the Admiralty Square, but
whether they thought themselves not sufficiently
strong, or that they dreaded facing
majesty with these treasonable demonstrations,
they did not march upon the winter
palace, but took up their position against the
senate, where they were immediately joined
by the grenadier corps, and sixty men in
frocks with pistols in their hands, who mingled
themselves among the rebel soldiers.</p>

<p>The emperor at this crisis appeared from
under one of the arches of the palace, approached
the grating, and threw a rapid
glance on his revolted subjects. He was
paler than usual, but was composed and calm.
It was whispered that he had resolved to die
as became a Christian emperor, and that he
had confessed and received absolution of the
Church, before he took leave of his family.
Every eye was fixed upon him, when the hard
gallop of a squadron of cuirassiers was heard
on the side of the marble palace; it was the
horse-guards, headed by Count Orloff, one
of the bravest and most faithful friends of the
emperor. Before him the gates expanded;
he leaped from his charger, while the regiment
ranged itself before the palace. The roll of
the drums announced instantly the approach
of the grenadiers of Preobrajenski, which
arrived in battalions. They entered the court
of the palace, where they found the emperor
with the empress, and their eldest son,
the little Grand-duke Alexander; behind
them were ranged the Chevalier guard, who
formed an angle with the cuirassiers, leaving
between them an open space, which was
quickly filled up by the artillery. The revolted
regiments regarded these military dispositions
with apparent carelessness, while
their cries of "Long live Constantine!"
"Down with Nicholas!" evidently proved
that they expected, and waited there for reinforcements.</p>

<p>While affairs were in this state at the palace,
the Grand-duke Michael, at the barracks,
was opposing his personal influence to the
flood-tide of rebellion. Some happy results
had followed these attempts, and the bold
resolution taken by Count Lieven, captain of
the sixth company of the Regiment of Moscow,
who arrived in time to shut the gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
against the battalion, then about to join their
rebel comrades. Placing himself before the
soldiers, he drew his sword, and swore on his
honor to pass the weapon through the body
of the first man who should make a seditious
movement to re-open them. At this threat,
a young sub-lieutenant advanced, pistol in
hand, towards Count Lieven, with the evident
intention of blowing out his brains.
The count, with admirable presence of mind,
struck the officer a blow with the pummel of
his sword, which made the instrument leap
from his hands; the lieutenant took up the
pistol and once more took aim at the count.
The young nobleman crossed his arms, and
confronted the mutinous officer, while the
regiment, mute and motionless, looked on
like the seconds of this singular duel. The
lieutenant drew back a few steps, followed by
the heroic count, who offered him his unarmed
breast as if in defiance of his attempt.
The lieutenant fired, but the ball took no effect:
that it did not strike that generous
breast appeared miraculous. Some one
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" asked many voices.</p>

<p>"His Imperial Highness the Grand-duke
Michael," replied those without.</p>

<p>Some instants of profound silence followed
this announcement. Count Lieven availed
himself of the general stupefaction to open
the door, no person attempting to prevent
that action.</p>

<p>The Grand-duke entered on horseback, followed
by the officers of ordnance.</p>

<p>"What means this inaction at a moment
of danger?" asked the Grand-duke. "Am
I among traitors or loyal soldiers?"</p>

<p>"You are in the midst of the most faithful
of your regiments," replied the Count,
"of which your Imperial Highness shall have
immediate proof." Then raising his drawn
sword, he cried, "Long live the Emperor
Nicholas!"</p>

<p>"Long live the Emperor Nicholas!"
shouted the soldiers with one voice.</p>

<p>The young sub-lieutenant attempted to
speak, but Count Lieven stopped him by
touching his arm. "Silence, sir; I shall not
mention what has passed; and you will ruin
yourself by the utterance of a syllable."</p>

<p>His magnanimity awed and convinced the
disloyal officer.</p>

<p>"Lieven, I confide to you the conduct
of this regiment," remarked the Grand-duke
emphatically.</p>

<p>"I will answer for its loyalty with my
life, your Imperial Highness," replied the
Count.</p>

<p>The Grand-duke departed, and on his
rounds, if he received no enthusiastic greeting,
at least found what he sought, obedience
to the authority of the Emperor Nicholas.</p>

<p>Reinforcements came in on every side; the
Sappers and Miners drew up in order of battle,
before the palace of the Hermitage; the
rest of the Regiment of Moscow, rescued
from the stain of rebellion by the courage
and address of Count Lieven, now proudly
debouched by the Perspective of Niewski.
The sight of these troops gave a delusive
hope to the revolted, who, believing them to
be on their side, greeted them with loud
cheers; but they were instantly undeceived,
for the new-comers ranged themselves along
the Hotel of the Tribunals, facing the palace,
and with the Cuirassiers, Artillery, and Chevalier
guards, inclosed the revolted in a circle
of steel.</p>

<p>A moment after, they heard the chant of
the priests. It was the Patriarch, who came
out of the church of Casan, followed by all his
clergy, and preceded by the holy banners.
He now commanded the revolted "in the
name of heaven, to return to their duty."
The soldiers, for the first time perhaps in
their lives, regarded with contempt the pictures
which they had been accustomed from
infancy to regard with superstitious veneration,
and they desired the Patriarch "to let
them alone, since if heavenly things belonged
to the priestly jurisdiction, they could take
care of those of earth." The Patriarch continued
his injunctions to obedience, notwithstanding
this discouraging rebuff, but the
Emperor ordered him to desist and retire.
Nicholas himself was resolved to make one
effort to bring back these rebels to their
duty.</p>

<p>Those who surrounded the Emperor wished
to prevent him from risking his person,
but he boldly replied, "It is my game that is
playing, and it is but fair play on my part to
set my life on the stake."</p>

<p>He ordered the gate to be opened, but
scarcely had he been obeyed, before the Grand-duke
Michael approached him, and whispered
in his ear that that part of the Regiment Preobrajenski
by which he was then surrounded,
had made common cause with the rebels, and
that the Prince T., their commander, whose
absence he had remarked with astonishment,
was at the head of the conspiracy. Nicholas
remembered that four-and-twenty years before
the same regiment had kept guard before
the red palace, while its Colonel, Prince Talitzen,
strangled the Emperor Paul, his father.</p>

<p>His situation was terrible, but he did not
even change countenance; he only showed
that he had formed a desperate resolution. In
an instant he turned and gave his orders to
one of his generals, "Bring me hither the
Grand-duke."</p>

<p>The general returned with the young prince:
the Emperor raised the boy in his arms, and
advancing to the grenadiers, said, "Soldiers,
if I am killed, behold your sovereign. Open
your ranks; I confide him to your loyalty."</p>

<p>A long, loud hurrah, a cry of enthusiasm
that came from the very heart of these suspected
soldiers, re&euml;choed to that of the Emperor,
whose magnanimous confidence had
won their admiration. The most guilty among
them dropped their weapons and opened their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
arms to receive the heir of the Empire. The
imperial pledge was placed with colors in the
midst of the regiment, a guarded and sacred
asylum for honor and innocence.</p>

<p>The Emperor mounted his horse and went
out of the gate, where he was met by his
generals, who implored him not to go any
further, as the rebels openly avowed their intention
of killing their sovereign, and their
arms were loaded. The Emperor made a
sign to them with his hand to leave him a
free passage, and forbidding them to accompany
him, spurred his horse and galloped
forward till he arrived within pistol-shot.
"Soldiers," cried he, "I am told that you
wish to kill me. Is that true? If it is, here
I am!"</p>

<p>There was a pause, while the Emperor sat
on horseback, remaining like an equestrian
statue between the two bodies of troops.
Twice the word fire was heard among the
rebel ranks, and twice some feeling of respect
to the dauntless courage of the sovereign
restrained the execution of the order;
but at the third command some muskets loaded
with ball were discharged, which whistled
past the Emperor without striking him, but
wounded, at a hundred paces behind him,
Colonel Velho and many soldiers.</p>

<p>At that moment the Grand-duke Michael
and Count Milarodowich galloped towards
the Emperor, the regiment of cuirassiers and
those of the Chevalier guards made a forward
movement&mdash;the artillerymen were about to
apply their matches to the cannon.</p>

<p>"Halt," cried the Emperor. All obeyed.
"General," said he to Count Milarodowich,
"go to these unfortunate men and endeavor
to bring them to their allegiance."</p>

<p>The Count and the Grand-duke Michael
rode forward, but the rebels received them
with a shower of ball, accompanied by their
war-cry, "Live Constantine!"</p>

<p>"Soldiers," cried the Count, who was conspicuous
alike by his fine martial figure and
splendid uniform covered with orders; "soldiers,
behold this sabre," and he flourished
above his head a magnificent Turkish one,
the hilt of which was set with jewels, and
advancing with it to the front ranks of the
rebels, he continued, "This sabre was given
me by his Imperial Highness the Czarowitz,
and on my honor, I will make oath upon its
blade, that you have been deceived, that the
Czarowitz has abdicated the imperial crown,
and that your real and legitimate sovereign is
the Emperor Nicholas."</p>

<p>Cries of "Live Constantine!" and the report
of a pistol were the replies given by the
revolted to the address of the Count, whose
action with the sword arm had left his side
exposed to the enemy. He was seen to reel
in the saddle. Another pistol was aimed at
the Grand-duke Michael, but the soldiers of
the Marine, though included in the revolt,
seized the arm of the assassin.</p>

<p>Count Orloff and the cuirassiers faced the
heavy fire of the musketry, and enveloped in
their ranks the wounded Milarodowich, the
Grand-duke Michael and the Emperor Nicholas,
whom they carried off by force to the
palace.</p>

<p>The Count, wounded to death, sat his
horse with difficulty, and the moment he arrived
at the palace, fell into the arms of those
who surrounded him.</p>

<p>The Emperor, notwithstanding the late unfortunate
attempt, still wished to make one
last endeavor to bring back the revolted, but
while he was issuing orders to that effect,
the Grand-duke Michael seized the match:
"Fire," cried he, "fire upon the assassins."
At that moment four cannons opened upon
the rebels, and paid with usury the deaths
they had sent into the loyal ranks of the imperialists.
Before the voice of the Emperor
could stop the slaughter, a second discharge
followed the first. The effect of these volleys
within reach of pistol-shot was terrible.
More than sixty men of the grenadier corps
of the Regiment of Moscow and the Marine
guards fell; the rebel troops fled, some by
the street Galernain, some by the English
quay or by the bridge Isaac, others across the
frozen waters of the Neva, then a plain of
ice, but all were hotly pursued by the Chevalier
guards at full gallop.</p>

<p>That evening Count Milarodowich, who
was struggling with the agonies of death, expressed
a wish to see the bullet which had
given him his mortal wound. The chirurgeon,
who had successfully traced and extracted
the ball, put it into his patient's hand. The
expiring warrior carefully examined the missive,
its weight, and form, and found it deficient
in calibre. "I am satisfied," said he,
"that ball was aimed by no soldier." Five
minutes after these words, he breathed his
last. He then paid the debt of nature, the
only debt he ever paid in his life. Handsome,
valiant, the finest horseman in the army, and
the idol of his own soldiers, the Russian Murat
lost his life by the hand of a Russian, but
not of a Russian soldier. The rival of the <i>cidevant</i>
King of Naples loved display in every
shape; but the field of battle, at the head of
his cavalry, was the theatre on which he best
loved to exhibit his martial form, splendid
horsemanship, and daring courage. The gaming-table
found him as reckless of his fortune
as the field of his life, and the bravest cavalry
general in the Russian service was a ruined
gamester, loaded with debts which his death
acquitted by leaving him insolvent. In paying
the debt of nature Count Milarodowich
surrendered his only personal possession.</p>

<p>The next day, at nine o'clock in the morning,
while the population of his capital was
yet uncertain whether the rebellion was effectually
crushed, Nicholas, Emperor of Russia,
gave his hand to the Empress to assist her
into a droski which stood before the gates of
the winter-palace, and drove through the
streets of St. Petersburg. He stopped before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
the barracks as if to offer his bold bosom to
the bullet or the steel of the assassin. The
sight of his fine countenance, shadowed by
the floating plumes of his military hat, far
from exciting treasonable demonstrations,
awakened lively expressions of loyalty and
devotion to his person, and cries of "Long
live Nicholas!" greeted his fortunate rashness.
The Russian people knew and recognized in
him a brave man and great sovereign.</p>

<p>The trial of the chief conspirators took
place under the shadow of night and secrecy;
they were brought from all parts of the empire
to St. Petersburg. The sentence, but
not the examination of the guilty, alone was
made public; eighty persons were condemned
to death, or life-long exile in Siberia. The
most powerful, according to the custom of
Russia, increased the population of Siberia;
among these we find the name of Prince T.:
his wife, with rare devotion, petitioned and
obtained from the Emperor permission to accompany
her husband to that dreary land of
woe and crime. The decimation of the disloyal
but seduced regiments was an act of
severe military justice that astonished Europe,
but secured the tranquillity of Russia.
The son of the Emperor Paul, whose life and
death had been the stake of the military contest
of December, 1825, might be better excused
than any other man for that tremendous
sentence. He had been fired upon by
his own soldiers while unarmed and confiding
his person to their generosity; his brother,
and his plenipotentiary, Count Milarodowich,
had been aimed at by assassins, and the Count
had died of his wound.</p>

<p>A flash of magnanimity enlightened this
cloud of severity. In the list of conspirators
the Emperor remarked the name of Suwarrow,
a name dear to Russia and associated
with her victories. He chose to examine
this young man, the grandson of the great
field-marshal, himself. His countenance and
manner, unusually gentle, seemed to inspire
confidence. The questions he asked this lieutenant
only required a simple affirmative or
denial, and they were not of a nature to elicit
a confession of guilt. "Gentlemen, you see
and hear," remarked the Emperor to his council,
"it is as I have told you, a Suwarrow cannot
be a rebel," and he acquitted the prisoner,
and gave him a captain's commission and
sent him back to his regiment; but unfortunately
for the conspirators, this lieutenant
was the only person who bore that favored
name. All were not Suwarrows.</p>

<p>It was remarked that those who were executed
uttered these words as their last legacy
to posterity, "Live Russia! Live Liberty! our
avengers are at hand!" Their war-cry of
"Live Constantine!" false to their hearts,
was not repeated by lips which the presence
of death had rendered then the echo of truth.</p>

<p>The funeral pomp of the widowed Empress
Elizabeth, whose remains were brought for
interment to St. Petersburg in this same
month of December, turned the thoughts of
its inhabitants from these scenes of civil strife
and the executions that followed them, to a
Princess, whom for twenty-four years they
had regarded as a link between the human
and angelic natures. The memory of these
events seemed buried in that sepulchre, which
the tears of a grateful people had consecrated
to the remembrance of the consort of the deceased
Emperor Alexander.</p>

<h2>DRINKING EXPERIENCES.</h2>


<p>The pleasure imparted by wine to me is
great, but very short-lived: it appears to
mount, as it were, to a crisis; after which it
somewhat rapidly declines. In fact, it does
not enliven me beyond a certain pitch.
It then ceases its charms; doubtless, because
my stomach, the centre of all sympathy, feels
oppressed by it. I grow dull, my head aches,
I am inclined for sleep, and wish for bed.&mdash;But
it does not rob me of self-possession, nor
incline me to wrangle or quarrel. On the
contrary, it excites my love, not my hatred,
and greatly expands my heart. I have granted
many a favor, and promised many more,
by the inspiration of the jolly god. I have
shaken hands with, sworn eternal friendship
for, many a man, and made love to many a
woman, for whom, vulgarly speaking, I cared
not a rush. In short, I have a hundred times
made a fool of myself by talking, boasting&mdash;not
lying, for I have ever held that low vice
in abhorrence&mdash;and occasionally laid wagers,
and matched horses, without a chance
of winning. But, as I have already stated, I
never was so overcome by wine as not to
know where I was, and what I said. In fact,
it never had the power to make me forget
that I was born a gentleman; and I am happy
in the reflection, that I have travelled thus
far through life without having been once
called upon to make an apology for an insult
given, either when drunk or sober; nor to
demand but two, and those were the result
of excess in wine. One was tendered to me
on the first dawn of returning reason; the
other, I am sorry to say, at the pistol's mouth.
But the events I am alluding to occurred
many years back, when, as a well-known
sporting old earl of the last century said of
himself, "the devil was very strong in me."</p>

<p>I never was drunk, from drinking spirits,
more than twice, which was with very strong
brandy and water. Now he that praises
drunkenness is a sot convicted on his own
evidence; but were I to drink for what is
called drinking's sake&mdash;that is, to acquire an
artificial state of pleasurable excitement&mdash;brandy
should be the liquor I should fly to to
secure it. The "divine luxuries of opium"
I never yet tasted; but the powers of wine
upon me are, comparatively with brandy,
truly insignificant. At the period I am alluding
to, it not only appeared to afford me a
sure panacea for all evils, past, present, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
to come, but to open unlimited prospects of
future bliss. I felt as if I were possessed of
more than human powers, and that there was
nothing I willed I could not do. In short, it
eventually made me mad; and, on each occasion,
I nearly lost my life, together with
my senses. On the one, I attempted to go to
sea, by moonlight, in a small open boat, without
either rudder or sail, and in the current
of a strong tide running out of a Welsh bay;
on the other, although more than two hundred
miles distant from it, I got upon a coachbox
to go to London, in my evening dress;
and did "go," till I tumbled off it into the
road. To the latter excursion I was no doubt
indebted to my early propensity to driving
coaches; but having at no time of my life
had a fancy for the sea, I owed my intended
aquatic trip to a member of the yacht club,
who was my partner in the debauch. Death,
says Johnson, is more than usually unwelcome
to a rich man; and as my friend is possessed
of ten thousand a year, he was by no
means a fit subject to be mangled by Welsh
crabs. Had we, however, accomplished our
purpose in unmooring the boat, we should
never have been heard of in this world any
more. The day would have come upon us
both "unawares."</p>

<p>To return to wine. The effect of wine
is generally supposed to invigorate the understanding,
and to stimulate the mental
powers&mdash;of poets, especially. Thus Horace
asks Bacchus whither he is about to transport
him? But by the words "<i>tui plenum</i>,"
I think he must have meant full, not of his
wine, but of his divinity, without the aid of
which he felt himself unequal to pen a panegyric
upon Octavius. Now, were I to say that
it is in the power of wine to sink me below mortality&mdash;in
other words, to make a brute of me&mdash;I
should certainly go beyond my tether; but
I can safely assert that, if I were a poet, so
far from realizing Horace's expectations of it,
it would lead me <i>down</i>, not up, the hill. In
fact, when under its immediate influence&mdash;I
do not mean drunk, but "pretty considerably
sprung," as the term is&mdash;I can scarcely
indite a common letter. It appears to stultify
my ordinary capacities. I must, however,
admit that, on the first waking after a plentiful
allowance of good wine, some bright
thoughts have come across my mind, and,
when not lost by an intervening nap, have
been found worthy of being noted down, and
now and then made serviceable. It would
indeed be an act of ingratitude to the jolly
god, were I to omit the fact, that I once
did rise from my bed, at four o'clock in the
morning, after having sacrificed largely the
overnight, and wrote the best thing I ever
did write; at least, so said a certain learned
sergeant, who now wears a silk gown, and
who told me he would have given five hundred
pounds to have been the author of it.
But it never saw the light. It was a satire;
and "<i>Nulla venenato litera mixta joco est</i>,"
has ever been, and shall ever continue to be,
my motto. I wish not to dip my pen in gall.</p>

<p>I have found wine, taken to excess for only
a few days, to depress the mind more than
the body; that is to say, when, as a friend
of mine expresses himself, "the <i>animus</i> is
flown;" and I once heard this natural effect
of over-mental excitement admirably illustrated
by a very illiterate coachman of the old
school. "Was Jem drunk when he upset
his coach the other night?" was a question
I put to one of this fraternity some years
back, when drinking to excess with them was
the order of both day and night. "Why,
sir," he replied, "he warn't drunk, nor he
warn't sober; <i>the liquor was a-dying in him,
and he was stupid</i>." Now, this strongly resembles
my own case. Had I to write for a
prize, and that prize were immortality, I
would not depend much upon the assistance
of Bacchus. I would rather rely on my own
natural powers, gently stimulated by wine
when they flagged.</p>

<p>In all ages of the world, however, clever
men, and poets especially, have been more or
less addicted to drinking to excess. The
austere Cato, the voluptuous C&aelig;sar, were
each given to what Seneca calls the <i>intemperantia
bibendi</i>&mdash;notwithstanding which,
according to Seneca, the wisdom of the former
received no blemish from this cause.
His daughter, indeed, admitted that it softened
the rigor of her father's virtues. Titus,
the delight of human kind, sat late after
his dinner: his brother, Domitian, the tyrant
and fly-tormentor, never later than the setting
sun. The influence of wine upon poets
has long since been proverbial. Poetry, in
fact, has been called the wine of the mind;
and wine, like love, makes poets. The old
Greeks drank and sang; and Anacreon would
not have been Anacreon, but for the inspiring
juice of the grape, as he himself tells us in
his celebrated hymn to the full-blown rose&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Crown me, and instant, god of wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strains from my lyre shall reach thy shrine."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Indeed, the first prize contended for by poets
was a cask of wine; and the Bacchic hymn
was called "The Hymn of the Cask." Horace,
in fact, pronounces a water-drinking
poet to be little worth&mdash;even the springs of
Castalia will not avail; but after his bottle
of Falernian, he boldly asserts, in his ode to
Bacchus, in which he wishes to soap C&aelig;sar,
that no daring was then too great for his
muse.</p>

<p>Both Homer and Horace must have liked
wine, and experience on occasions its good effects,
or they would not have been the authors
of such glowing panegyrics upon it. It
is true the latter is moral in the midst of his
gayety, uniting the wisdom of the philosopher
with the playfulness of the poet; still,
and notwithstanding he preaches up moderation
in desires, as the chief source of human
happiness, he must have been <i>secretly</i> attached
to the Epicurean school, in our acceptation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
of that term. We may, I think, glean
this from various passages of his several
works, and especially from the compliment
he pays Tibullus on the knowledge he displays
of the <i>savoir vivre</i> at his own house
and table. Again, although in his ode to
Apollo he wished us to believe he did not
like it, the one to his Cask is an incentive to
<i>drinking</i>. In another to Telephus, he himself
gets "as drunk as a lord;" and had a
pretty good bousing match on his escape from
the tree, as well as at his party on C&aelig;sar's
birth-day. Then how does he promise to
welcome Mac&aelig;nas when he came to sup with
him? <i>To take a hundred bumpers with him
for friendship's sake!</i> Neither is this all.
Notwithstanding his telling his friend that
his wine was not such as <i>he</i> ought to drink, it
is evident he did not "think small beer of
it" himself. He notes its age, seals the casks
with his own hands, and taps a fresh one on
any very memorable occasion. In short, but
for a bodily infirmity to which he was subject,
there is little doubt but he would have
been one of the jolly dogs of his own day.
At all events, as has been elegantly said of
him, "he tuned his harp to pleasure, and to
easy temper of his own soul."</p>

<p>How happens it, it may be asked, that not
a single Grecian has ascended Parnassus for
so many ages back, and that the vocal hills
of Arcadia no longer resound to the Doric
reed? There are, we know, several reasons
given for this, such as a despotic government,
alteration in the language, &amp;c., &amp;c.; but the
most powerful cause of the literary degeneracy
of this once justly celebrated people is,
doubtless, in the substitution of the enervating
luxuries of coffee, tobacco, and opium,
for the invigorating powers of good wine.
It was not so in Anacreon's days.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the eminently gifted
men of later times. Sir Richard Steele spent
half his hours in a tavern. In fact, he may
be said to have measured time by the bottle;
as on being sent for by his wife, he returned
for answer that "he would be with her in
half a bottle." The like may be said of Savage;
and Addison was as dull as an alderman
till he was three parts drunk. Neither
would he stop at that point. It is on record
of him that he once drank till he vomited in
the company of Voltaire; which called forth
the cutting remark, that the only good thing
that came out of his mouth, in Voltaire's
presence, was the wine that had gone into it.
It is also recorded of Pitt, but I cannot vouch
for the truth of it, that two bottles of port
wine per diem was his usual allowance, and
that it was to <i>potens Bacchus</i> he was indebted
for the almost superhuman labor he went
through during his short, but actively employed
life. His friend and colleague, Harry
Dundas, a clever man also in his way,
went the pace with him over the mahogany;
and the joke about the Speaker in his chair,
after they had dined together, cannot be forgotten.
Pitt could see no Speaker; but his
friend, like Horace with the candle, saw two.
Sheridan, latterly, without wine, was a driveller.
He sacrificed to it talents such as no
man I ever heard or read of possessed, for no
subject appeared to be beyond his reach. I
knew him when I was a boy, and thought
him then something more than human. The
learned Porson would get drunk in a pothouse&mdash;so
would Robert Burns, the poet;
and Byron drank brandy and water by bucketsful.
Fox was a thirsty soul, and drank far
too much wine for either a politician or a
play-man; yet, like Nestor over the bowl, he
was always great. But a contemporary of
his, likewise a great play-man and a clever
fellow, out-heroded Herod. He estimated his
losses in hogsheads of claret; and it was humorously
said of John Taylor&mdash;for such was his
name&mdash;that, after a certain hour of the night,
"he could not be removed <i>without a permit</i>,
as he had more than a dozen of claret on
board." Two of the finest actors that ever
graced the British stage could scarcely be
kept sober enough to perform their parts:
But enough of this. Wine taken in excess is
the bane of talent. Like fire upon incense,
it may cause rich fumes to escape; but the
dregs and refuse, when the sacrifice is ended,
are little worth. By a long continuance, indeed,
in any vicious indulgence, the mind,
like the body, is reduced to a state of atrophy;
and knowledge, like food, passes through
it without adding to its strength. But repeated
vinous intoxication soonest unfits a
man for either mental or bodily exertion.
Equally with the effect of violent love, so
powerfully set forth by the poet Lucretius,
it creates an indolence and listlessness which
damps all noble pursuits, as well as a neglect
of all useful affairs&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Labitur interea res et vadimonia fiunt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Languent officia, atque &aelig;grotat fama vacillans."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are countries&mdash;half civilised ones,
of course&mdash;in which intoxication is esteemed
the greatest of human pleasures; and Lord
Bacon thought it only second to love. Much
of the folly of drunkenness, however, in the
middle and upper orders of society, proceeds
from a laudable desire to exercise in the
extreme the rites of hospitality. To the
"honest pride of hospitality," as Byron calls it,
many a man who hates drinking, has given
many a slice of his perhaps already shaken
constitution. And here is really something
like an excuse. Independently of the making
welcome our friends, and seeing ourselves
surrounded by them under our own roof,
being one of the first among the ordinary
comforts of life, hospitality has ever been considered
a primary social duty. The best definition
of real hospitality is given by Cicero,
who admits that there is nothing that contributes
more effectually to the happiness of
human life than society,&mdash;distinguishing
from the sensual gratification of the palate, the
pleasing relaxation of the mind, which he says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
is best produced by the freedom of social
converse, always most agreeable at the table.
Neither does he appear to be an enemy to a
cheerful glass; and we must admire the
definition he gives of drinking parties. "The
Greeks," says he, "call them by a word which
signifies computations, whereas we more emphatically
denominate them convivial meetings;
intimating thereby, that it is in a
communication of this nature that life is most
truly enjoyed." That Cicero, however, was
temperate, may be concluded by the fact of his
having written when past his sixtieth year
his celebrated Philippies, in which his powers
of reasoning are more vigorous, and his language
more touching, than in any of his former
and younger orations. He used wine in
moderation; and it is thus that it answers the
ends of Providence. It then exhilarates and
strengthens the mind, as well as the body,
and, like the bloom on the female cheek,
beautifies it, and shows health.</p>

<p>There are said to be three modes of bearing
the ills of life, indifference, philosophy, and
religion; and many add&mdash;the bottle. But
the effect of wine on grief is of a doubtful
nature. It may deaden the pang for a while,
but it will return on the morrow with redoubled
force, and with the powers of the sufferer
less equal to contend with it. Nevertheless,
the maxim of Anacreon, that "when Bacchus
enters our cares sleep," is in part true; and a
temporary oblivion of care and disappointment
is generally produced by an agreeable
party and good cheer. And thus is Shakespeare
justified in calling wine the merry
cheerer of the human heart, as well as others
who have asserted that it not only creates
pleasure, but mitigates pain. For the latter
purpose, indeed, it was formerly given to
condemned malefactors, previously to their
suffering; "Give strong drink to him who
is ready to perish," says the author of the
book of Proverbs, "and wine unto them that

forget his poverty, and remember his misery

<p>If a tranquil mind and freedom from pain
make up the sum of a happy life, how great
is the value of this cordial drop, and how
thankful should we be for it! How sacred
and profane writers agree in the essential qualities
of the pure juice, especially in the relief
of wretchedness. "See the blind beggar
dance, the cripple sing," is no exaggeration
of its power in lessening anguish from past
misfortunes, or present ills; but in the following
translation of a fragment of Bacchylides,
we see what rays of brightness it can throw
over our future prospects:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thirsty comrade! would'st thou know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the raptures that do flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From those sweet compulsive rules<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our ancient drinking schools?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, the precious draught shall raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amorous thoughts in giddy maze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingling Bacchus' present treasure<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Yet guided by my own experience, of the
various effects of wine on the mind, I cannot
go quite the length of some of its panegyrists.
So far, indeed, from thinking with Ovid that
it takes even the wrinkles out of the face, I
am more inclined to believe that it adds to
their number by the excitement that it
creates; and although the festive pleasures of
the table, in addition to the society of friends,
may cheer the heart, and even irradiate
gloom, the talisman is not there by which
the cause may be reached, and the pain
destroyed, beyond the hour.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Though gay companions o'er the bowl<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dispel awhile the sense of ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though pleasure fires the madd'ning soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The heart&mdash;the heart is lonely still."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No&mdash;although I fear I am about to speak
without experience now&mdash;it is my opinion,
that neither the resources of the philosopher,
nor the consolations of religion, nor conscious
worth, unaccompanied by native fortitude
and energy of mind, are of much avail against
real grief. Why they should not be, is no
business of mine to inquire; nor would it be
becoming me to question the designs of Providence.
But this much I may affirm without
fear of offence,&mdash;Human life is prudently
chequered with good and evil; and the most
likely way to enjoy it, is to make the best of
the one while the other is away.</p>

<p>The powerful influence of wine on society
is estimated by Dr. Johnson, in the <i>Rambler</i>:
"In the bottle," says he, "discontent seeks
for comfort, cowardice for courage, and bashfulness
for confidence." Nothing is more
true than this; although it sometimes happens
that the first is looked for in vain, the
second proves false, and the latter exceeds its
bounds. The union of sensual and intellectual
enjoyment, however, is requisite to complete
the happiness of "the double animal"&mdash;the
perfect man; and as all mankind are not
philosophers, much less abstract ones, after-dinner
conversation would generally be flat
without the genial influence of good wine.
Indeed, the wit of the wittiest man, and the
most agreeable companion I ever sat down
with, appeared to rise in brilliancy with
every glass he drank; and when, to use an
expression of his own, he felt himself "vinously
inclined,"&mdash;that is to say, when he had
what Cicero calls the "<i>furor vinolentus</i>"
upon him, there were no bounds to his humorous
sallies.</p>

<p>Upon old men wine is generally well bestowed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash;Give me a bowl of wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have not that alacrity of spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span></p>
<p>exclaims the bold King Richard; and I once
heard a fine old sportsman, and very worthy
man, declare, after a bottle of good port, that
he would not exchange the present&mdash;his eightieth
year&mdash;for the gayest he had ever spent.</p>

<p>Luckily for the credit of the human race&mdash;although
Cleopatra hunted and <i>drank</i> with
Antony&mdash;there has been, in all ages of the
world, a sense of shame attached to the vice
of drunkenness in women, having any pretensions
to character, as something contrary
to their more refined nature. By the ancient
Roman laws it was punishable even by death;
and we find that even the abandoned women
who celebrated the Bacchanalia were ashamed
to do so, except under the disguise of
masks.</p>

<p>To the credit of the present age, drunkenness
in women is not a common failing; but when
they once yield to the vice, they have less
moderation in the indulgence of it than men
have. That such was the case in other ages
and countries, may be gleaned from a passage
in a comic play-writer, contemporary with Plato,
which has been thus accurately rendered:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Remark how wisely ancient art provides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broad-brimmed cup, with flat expanded sides;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cup contrived for <i>man's</i> discreeter use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sober potions of the generous juice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But <i>woman's</i> more ambitious, thirsty soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon long'd to revel in the plenteous bowl;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep and capacious as the swelling hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some stout bark, she shaped the hollow mould;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, turning out a vessel like a tun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Simpering, exclaimed&mdash;<i>Observe, I drink but one</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To return to the effect of wine on the ruder
sex. Next to a smoky house and a scolding
wife, it is the greatest trial of the temper
to which that of man is exposed. In fact, it
is a test by which it may be proved; and the
advice of Horace is excellent, <i>not to choose a
friend till we have put him to this test</i>. Addison
is likewise happy in his remark on this
point. "Wine," says he, "is not to be drunk
by all who can swallow;" and truer words
were never written. It has an extraordinary
effect upon low and uncultivated minds;
as was exemplified in late times, when war
prices and abundance of money placed it
within the reach of the English commonalty.
Rows and broils, with marked insolence towards
superiors, were the concomitant results.
Neither is the observation of Pliny a whit less
just. He says truth is vulgarly and <i>properly</i>
attributed to wine; and I am decidedly of his
opinion. In fact, our English term, "disguised
in liquor," is improperly used; inasmuch
as a blackguard when drunk is in his nature
a blackguard when sober. The tongue, says
the Bible, is at all times an unruly member;
but when under the influence of wine, it is
still more apt to run riot. Then, again,
drunken men are given to "err in vision and
stumble in judgment," and to put constructions
upon words which they were not intended
to convey. When we sacrifice to
Bacchus, we are not favored by Mercury;
and the well-known adage of "wine in, wit
out," is but an abbreviation of the equally
well proved axiom, that wine raises the imagination,
but depresses the judgment.</p>

<p>Neither is the highly bred gentleman, if
much addicted to intoxication, quite safe to
be admitted into close friendship, inasmuch
as he renders himself, by the practice, unworthy
of confidence. Wine so unlocks the
cabinet of the heart, that it is easily looked
into when we are off our guard.</p>

<h2>AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN SCENERY
COMPARED.</h2>


<p class="center">BY J. FENIMORE COOPER.</p>

<p>The great distinction between American
and European scenery, as a whole, is to
be found in the greater want of finish in the
former than in the latter, and to the greater
superfluity of works of art in the old world
than in the new. Nature has certainly made
some differences, though there are large portions
of continental Europe that, without
their artificial accessories, might well pass for
districts in our own region; and which forcibly
remind the traveller of his native home.
As a whole, it must be admitted that Europe
offers to the senses sublimer views and certainly
grander, than are to be found within
our own borders, unless we resort to the
Rocky Mountains, and the ranges in California
and New Mexico.</p>

<p>In musing on these subjects, the mind of
the untravelled American naturally turns
first towards England. He has pictured to
himself landscapes and scenery on which are
impressed the teeming history of the past.
We shall endeavour to point out the leading
distinctions between the scenery of England
and that of America, therefore, as the course
that will probably be most acceptable to the
reader.</p>

<p>The prevalent characteristic of the English
landscape is its air of snugness and comfort.
In these respects it differs entirely from its
neighbor, France. The English, no doubt,
have a great deal of poverty and squalid misery
among them. But it is kept surprisingly
out of the ordinary view. Most of it, indeed,
is to be found in the towns, and even in
them it is concealed in out of the way places
and streets seldom entered by the stranger.</p>

<p>There are places in America, more especially
in the vicinities of the large towns,
that have a strong resemblance to the more
crowded portions of England, though the
hedge is usually wanting and the stone wall
is more in favor among ourselves than it appears
ever to have been among our ancestors.
The great abundance of wood, in this country,
too, gives us the rail and the board for
our fences, objects which the lovers of the
picturesque would gladly see supplanted by
the brier and the thorn. All that part of
Staten Island, which lies nearest to the quarantine
ground, has a marked resemblance to
what we should term suburban English landscape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
The neighborhoods of most of the
old towns in the northern States, have more
or less of the same character; it being natural
that the descendants of Englishmen should
have preserved as many of the usages of their
forefathers as were practicable. We know of
no portion of this country that bears any
marked resemblance to the prevalent characteristics
of an ordinary French landscape.
In France there are two great distinctive features
that seem to divide the materials of the
views between them. One is that of a bald
nakedness of formal <i>grandes routes</i>, systematically
lined with trees, a total absence of
farm-houses, fences, hedges, and walls, little
or no forest, except in particular places,
scarcely any pieces of detached woods, and a
husbandry that is remarkable for its stiffness
and formality. The fields of a French acclivity,
when the grain is ripe, or ripening, have
a strong resemblance to an ordinary Manchester
pattern-card, in which the different
cloths, varying in color, are placed under the
eye at one glance. The effect of this is not
pleasing. The lines being straight and the
fields exhibiting none of the freedom of nature.
Stiffness and formality, indeed, impair
the beauty of nine-tenths of the French
landscapes; though as a whole the country
is considered fine, and is certainly very productive.
The other distinctive feature to
which we allude is of a directly contrary
character, being remarkable for the affluence
of its objects. It often occurs in that country
that the traveller finds himself on a
height that commands a view of great extent,
which is literally covered with <i>bourgs</i> or
small towns and villages. This occurs particularly
in Normandy, in the vicinity of Paris
and as one approaches the Loire. In such
places it is no unusual thing for the eye to
embrace, as it might be in a single view, some
forty or fifty cold, grave-looking, chiselled
<i>bourgs</i> and villages, almost invariably erected
in stone. The effect is not unpleasant, for
the subdued color of the buildings has a tendency
to soften the landscape and to render
the whole solemn and imposing. We can
recall many of these scenes that have left indelible
impressions on the mind, and which,
if not positively beautiful in a rural sense,
are very remarkable. That from the heights
of Montmorenci, near Paris, is one of them;
and there is another, from the hill of St.
Catharine, near Rouen, that is quite as extraordinary.</p>

<p>The greater natural freedom that exists in
an ordinary American landscape, and the
abundance of detached fragments of wood,
often render the views of this country strikingly
beautiful when they are of sufficient extent
to conceal the want of finish in the details,
which require time and long-continued
labor to accomplish. In this particular we
conceive that the older portions of the United
States offer to the eye a general outline of
view that may well claim to be even of a
higher cast, than most of the scenery of the
old world.</p>

<p>There is one great charm, however, that it
must be confessed is nearly wanting among
us. We allude to the coast. Our own is,
with scarcely an exception, low, monotonous
and tame. It wants Alpine rocks, bold promontories,
visible heights inland, and all those
other glorious accessories of the sort that render
the coast of the Mediterranean the wonder
of the world. It is usual for the American
to dilate on the size of his bays and rivers,
but objects like these require corresponding
elevation in the land. Admirable as is
the bay of New-York for the purposes of
commerce, it holds but a very subordinate
place as a landscape among the other havens
of the world. The comparison with
Naples that has so often been made, is singularly
unjust, there not being two bays of any
extent to be found, that are really less alike
than these. It was never our good fortune to
see Constantinople or Rio de Janeiro, the two
noblest and most remarkable scenes of this
kind, as we have understood, known to the
traveller. But we much question if either
will endure the test of rigid and severe examination
better than the celebrated Gulf of
Napoli. The color of the water, alone, is a
peculiar beauty of all the Mediterranean bays:
it is the blue of the deep sea, carried home
to the very rocks of the coast. In this respect,
the shores of America, also, have less
claim to beauty than those of Europe, generally.
The waters are green, the certain sign
of their being shallow. Similar tints prevail
in the narrow seas between Holland and England.
The name of Holland recalls a land,
however, that is even lower than any portion
of our own with which we are acquainted.
There are large districts in Holland that are
actually below the level of the high tides of
the sea. This country is a proof how much
time, civilization, and persevering industry,
may add even to the interest of a landscape.
While the tameness of the American coast
has so little to relieve it or to give it character,
in Holland it becomes the source of wonder
and admiration. The sight of vast meadows,
villages, farm-houses, churches, and other
works of art, actually lying below the level
of the adjacent canals, and the neighboring
seas, wakes in the mind a species of reverence
for human industry. This feeling becomes
blended with the views, and it is scarcely
possible to gaze upon a Dutch landscape
without seeing, at the same time, ample pages
from the history of the country and the character
of its people. On this side of the ocean,
there are no such peculiarities. Time, numbers,
and labor, are yet wanting to supply the
defects of nature, and we must be content,
for a while, with the less teeming pictures
drawn in our youth and comparative simplicity.</p>

<p>On the American coast the prevailing character
is less marked at the northward and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>
eastward than at the southward. At some
future day, the Everglades of Florida may
have a certain resemblance to Holland. They
are the lowest land, we believe, in any part
of this country.</p>

<p>Taking into the account the climate and its
productions, the adjacent mountains, the most
picturesque outlines of the lakes, and the
works of art which embellish the whole, we
think that most lovers of natural scenery
would prefer that around the lakes of Como
and Maggiore to that of any other place familiarly
known to the traveller. Como is ordinarily
conceived to carry off the palm in
Europe, and it is not probable that the great
mountains of the East or any part of the Andes,
can assemble as many objects of grandeur,
sweetness, magnificence and art, as are
to be found in this region. Of course, our
own country has nothing of the sort to compare
with it. The Rocky Mountains, and
the other great ranges in the recent accession
of territory, must possess many noble views,
especially as one proceeds south; but the accessories
are necessarily wanting, for a union
of art and nature can alone render scenery
perfect.</p>

<p>In the way of the wild, the terrific, and
the grand, nature is sufficient of herself: but
Niagara is scarcely more imposing than she
is now rendered lovely by the works of man.
It is true that the celebrated cataract has a
marked sweetness of expression, if we may
use such a term, that singularly softens its
magnificence, and now that men are becoming
more familiar with its mysteries, and penetrating
into its very mists, by means of a
small steamboat, the admirer of nature discovers
a character different from that which
first strikes the senses.</p>

<p>We regard it as hypercritical to speak of the
want of Alpine scenery around Niagara. On
what scale must the mountains be moulded
to bear a just comparison, in this view of the
matter, with the grandeur of the cataract!
The Alps, the Andes, and the Himmalaya,
would scarcely suffice to furnish materials
necessary to produce the contrast, on any
measurement now known to the world. In
fact the accessories, except as they are blended
with the Falls themselves, as in the wonderful
gorge through which the river rushes,
in an almost fathomless torrent, as if frightened
at its own terrific leap; the Whirlpool,
and all that properly belongs to the stream,
from the commencement of the Rapids, or, to
be more exact, from the placid, lake-like
scenery above these Rapids, down to the
point where the waters of this mighty strait
are poured into the bosom of the Ontario,
strike us as being in singular harmony with
the views of the Cataract itself.</p>

<p>The Americans may well boast of their
waterfalls, and of their lakes, notwithstanding
the admitted superiority of upper Italy
and Switzerland in connection with the highest
classes of the latter. They form objects
of interest over a vast surface of territory,
and greatly relieve the monotony of the inland
views. We do not now allude to the
five great lakes, which resemble seas and offer
very much the same assemblage of objects
to the eye; but to those of greatly inferior
extent, that are sparkling over so much of
the surface of the northern states. The east,
and New-York in particular, abound in them,
though farther west the lover of the picturesque
must be content to receive the prairie
in their stead. It would be a great mistake,
however, to attempt to compare any of these
lakes with the finest of the old world; though
many of them are very lovely and all contribute
to embellish the scenery. Lake George
itself could not occupy more than a fourth or
fifth position in a justly graduated scale of
the lakes of Christendom; though certainly
very charming to the eye, and of singular variety
in its aspects. In one particular, indeed,
this lake has scarcely an equal. We allude
to its islands, which are said to equal the
number of the days in the year. Points,
promontories, and headlands are scarcely ever
substitutes for islands, which add inexpressibly
to the effect of all water-views.</p>

<p>It has been a question among the admirers
of natural scenery, whether the presence or
absence of detached farm-houses, of trees,
hedges, walls and fences, most contribute to
the effect of any inland view. As these are
three great points of distinction between the
continent of Europe and our own country,
we shall pause a moment to examine the subject
a little more in detail. When the towns
and villages are sufficiently numerous to catch
the attention of the eye, and there are occasional
fragments of forest in sight, one does not
so much miss the absence of that appearance
of comfort and animated beauty that the other
style of embellishment so eminently possesses.
A great deal, however, depends, as respects
these particulars, on the nature of the architecture
and the color of the buildings and
fences. It is only in very particular places
and under very dull lights, that the contrast
between white and green is agreeable.
A fence that looks as if it were covered with
clothes hung out to dry, does very little
towards aiding the picturesque. And he who
endeavors to improve his taste in these particulars,
will not fail to discover in time that
a range of country which gives up its objects,
chiselled and distinct, but sober, and sometimes
sombre, will eventually take stronger
hold of his fancy than one that is glittering
with the fruits of the paint and the whitewash
brushes. We are never dissatisfied
with the natural tints of stone, for the mind
readily submits to the ordering of nature;
and though one color may be preferred to
another, each and all are acceptable in their
proper places. Thus, a marble structure is
expected to be white, and as such, if the
building be of suitable dimensions and proportions,
escapes our criticism, on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
its richness and uses. The same may be said
of other hues, when not artificial; but we
think that most admirers of nature, as they
come to cultivate their tastes, settle down
into a preference for the gray and subdued
over all the brighter tints that art can produce.
In this particular, then, we give the
preference to the effects of European scenery,
over that of this country, where wood is so
much used for the purposes of building, and
where the fashion has long been to color it
with white. A better taste, however, or
what we esteem as such, is beginning to prevail,
and houses in towns and villages are
now not unfrequently, even painted in subdued
colors. We regard the effect as an improvement,
though to our taste no hue, in its
artificial objects, so embellishes a landscape
as the solemn color of the more sober, and
less meretricious looking stones.</p>

<p>We believe that a structure of white, with
green blinds, is almost peculiar to this country.
In the most propitious situations, and
under the happiest circumstances, the colors
are unquestionably unsuited to architecture,
which, like statuary, should have but one
tint. If, however, it be deemed essential to
the flaunting tastes of the mistress of some
mansion, to cause the hues of the edifice in
which she resides to be as gay as her <i>toilette</i>,
we earnestly protest against the bright green
that is occasionally introduced for such purposes.
There is a graver tint, of the same
color, that entirely changes the expression of a
dwelling. Place two of these houses in close
proximity, and scarcely an intellectual being
would pass them, without saying that the owner
of the one was much superior to the owner
of the other in all that marks the civilized man.
Put a third structure in the immediate vicinity
of these two, that should have but one color
on its surface, including its blinds, and we
think that nine persons in ten, except the
very vulgar and uninstructed, would at once
jump to the conclusion that the owner of this
habitation was in tastes and refinement superior
to both his neighbors. A great improvement,
however, in rural as well as in town
architecture, is now in the course of introduction
throughout all the northern states.
More attention is paid to the picturesque than
was formerly the case, and the effects are becoming
as numerous as they are pleasing.
We should particularize New Haven, as one
of those towns that has been thus embellished
of late years, and there are other places
of nearly equal size that might be mentioned
as having the same claims to an improved
taste. But to return to the great distinctive
features between an ordinary American landscape
and a similar scene in Europe. Of the
artificial accessories it is scarcely necessary
to say any more. One does not expect to
meet with a ruined castle or abbey, or even
fortress, in America; nor, on the other hand,
does the traveller look for the forests of
America, or that abundance of wood which
gives to nearly every farm a sufficiency for
all the common wants of life, on the plains
and heights of the old world. Wood there
certainly is, and possibly enough to meet the
ordinary wants of the different countries, but
it is generally in the hands of the governments
or the great proprietors, and takes the
aspect of forests of greater or less size that
are well cared for, cleared and trimmed like
the grounds of a park.</p>

<p>Germany has, we think, in some respects a
strong resemblance to the views of America.
It is not so much wanting in detached copses
and smaller plantations of trees as the countries
farther south and east of it, while it has
less of the naked aspect in general that is so
remarkable in France. Detached buildings
occur more frequently in Germany than in
France especially, and we might add also in
Spain. The reader will remember that it is
a prevalent usage throughout Europe, with
the exception of the British Islands, Holland,
and here and there a province in other countries,
for the rural population to dwell in villages.
This practice gives to the German
landscape, in particular, a species of resemblance
to what is ordinarily termed park
scenery, though it is necessarily wanting in
much of that expression which characterizes
the embellishments that properly belong to
the latter. With us this resemblance is often
even stronger, in consequence of the careless
graces of nature and the great affluence of
detached woods. The distinguishing feature
existing in the farm-house, fences and outbuildings.
Of a cloudy day, a distant view
in America often bears this likeness to the
park, in a very marked degree, for then the
graces of the scene are visible to the eye,
while the defects of the details are too remote
to be detected.</p>

<p>The mountain scenery of the United States,
though wanting in grandeur, and in that wild
sublimity which ordinarily belongs to a granite
formation, is not without attractions that are
singularly its own. The great abundance of
forest, the arable qualities of the soil, and the
peculiar blending of what may be termed the
agricultural and the savage, unite to produce
landscapes of extraordinary beauty and gracefulness.
Vast regions of country possessing
this character are to be found in almost all
the old states, for after quitting the coast for
a greater or less distance, varying from one
to two hundred miles, the ranges of the Alleghanies
interpose between the monotonous
districts of the Atlantic shores and the great
plains of the west. We are of opinion that
as civilization advances, and the husbandman
has brought his lands to the highest state of
cultivation, there will be a line of mountain
scenery extending from Maine to Georgia, in
a north and south direction, and possessing
a general width of from one to two hundred
miles, from east to west, that will scarcely
have a parallel in any other quarter of the
world, in those sylvan upland landscapes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>
which, while they are wanting in the sublimity
of the Alpine regions, share so largely
in the striking and effective.</p>

<p>It is usual for the American to boast of his
rivers, not only for their size and usefulness,
but for their beauties. A thousand streams,
that in older regions would have been rendered
memorable, ages since, by the poet,
the painter, art in every form, and the events
of a teeming history, flow within the limits
of the United States still unsung, and nearly
unknown. As yet, something is ordinarily
wanting, in the way of finish, along the banks
of these inferior water-courses. But occasionally,
in places where art has, as it might
be, accidentally assisted nature, they come
into the landscape with the most pleasing influence
on its charms. In this respect, the
peculiarity of the country is rather in a want
of uniformity than in any want of material.
To us, it would seem that all the northern
states of America, at least, are far better watered
than common, and that consequently
they possess more of this species of beauty.
As for the great streams, the largest, perhaps,
have the least claims to high character in
this respect in both the old and the new
world. The Rhine is an exception, however,
for it would be difficult to find another river
of equal length and with the same flow of
water, that possesses the same diversity of
character or one so peculiar. At its source it
descends from the high glaciers of the Alps
a number of howling brooks, which forcing
their way through the upper valleys, unite
below in a straggling, rapid, but shallow
stream, that finds its way into the lake of
Constance, out of which it issues a compact,
rapid river, imposing by its volume of water,
rather than by its breadth, or any other advantage.
Its cataracts, so celebrated in the
old world, can scarcely claim to be the equal
of the Cohoes, or many others of the secondary
falls of this country, though the Rhine
has always an abundance of water, which the
Mohawk has not. On quitting Switzerland,
this remarkable stream assumes many aspects,
and decorates, beyond a doubt, as much landscape
scenery as falls to the share of any
other stream in the known world. We do
not think it, however, in its best parts, equal
to the Hudson in its whole length, though
the characters of these two rivers are so very
different as scarcely to admit of a fair comparison.
Perhaps the most remarkable feature
of the Rhine is its termination, for after embellishing
and serving the purposes of such an
extent of country in the very heart of Europe,
it disappears, as it might be, in a number
of straggling, uninteresting, turbid waters,
among the marshes of Holland. This is a
very different exit from that which characterizes
the majestic flow of the Hudson into
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>England has no great rivers to boast of,
though she has a few of singular claims to
notice, on account of the great flow of the
tides and the vast amount of commerce that
they bear on the bosom. The Thames, so
renowned in history, is as uninteresting as
possible, until it passes above the bridges of
London, where it becomes an ordinary pretty
sylvan stream.</p>

<p>The Seine, another river, familiar in name,
at least, to every reader, has much higher
claims than its neighbor of the British Islands,
in the way of natural beauty. This stream,
from Rouen to the Channel, is not without
some very fine scenery, as well as possessing
a very variant and interesting character, with
both natural and artificial accessories, to say
nothing of the historical, that draw largely
on the attention.</p>

<p>Italy has many rivers that are celebrated
in song or story, but not one, we think, that
should rank high, on the ground of landscape
beauty. Most of her streams are so dependent
on the melting of the snows in the Apennines
and Alps, as to be either howling torrents,
or meagre, straggling pools. The Arno,
the Po, the Adige, the Tiber, and all the other
rivers of that peninsula, are obnoxious to
these objections. Even the Tiber, which is
navigable as high as Rome, for vessels of a
light draft, is either a tranquil thread, or one
of those noisy, turbid streams that overflow
their banks and often appear at a loss to know
in which direction to pour their waters.</p>

<p>The day is not distant, when America must
possess a vast extent of territory of a character
directly the reverse of that we have described
in our mountain scenery, but which,
nevertheless, will not be without a certain
magnificence from its extent, productions and
fertility. We allude to the great plains of
the West; those which lie between the bases
of the Alleghanies and the semi-sterile steppes
that are known in this part of the world as
the great prairies. Lombardy, teeming as she
is, with population, vines, and all the productions
of a fertile soil, in the possession of millions,
sinks into insignificance before the vast
plains that are destined to be her rivals in
this quarter of the world. Perhaps New-York
alone could furnish nearly as much of
this character of country as is to be found in
Upper Italy; for, stretching from the shores
of Ontario towards the southern ranges of
uplands, and as far east as Utica, is spread to
the eye a vast extent of the most fertile plain,
slightly relieved in places with a rolling surface
of very respectable claims to natural
beauty. We question if greater fertility is to
be found in any part of the world, than is
met with in the region last mentioned, though
drainage and the other works of an advanced
state of husbandry, are still much wanting to
bring forth both its fertility and its beauties.</p>

<p>New-York, indeed, in the way of scenery,
has very high claims to variety, gracefulness,
and even grandeur, among the mountains of
the counties bordering on Champlain. By
grandeur, however, let there be no mistake,
by receiving the term in any other than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
limited sense. Any well delineated view of
a high-class Swiss scene, must at once convince
even the most provincial mind among
us that nothing of the sort is to be found in
America, east of the Rocky mountains. Nevertheless,
the Adirondack has claims to a wild
grandeur, which, if it do not approach magnificence,
is of a character to impress a region
with the seal of a very noble nature. The
lovers of the picturesque sustain a great loss
by means of the numerous lines of railroads
that have recently come into existence. This
is true of both Europe and America. In the
course of time, it will be found that every
where a country presents its best face towards
its thoroughfares. Every thing that depends
on art, naturally takes this aspect, for men
are as likely to put on their best appearance
along a wayside in the country as on the
streets of a town. All that has been done,
therefore, in past ages, in these particulars, is
being deranged and in some instances deformed
by the necessity of preserving levels,
and avoiding the more valuable portions of a
country, in order to diminish expense. Thus
villages and towns are no longer entered by
their finest passages, producing the best effects;
but the traveller is apt to find his
view limited by ranges of sheds, out-houses,
and other deformities of that nature. Here
and there, some work of art, compelled by
necessity, furnishes a relief to this deformity.
But on the whole, the recent system of railroads
has as yet done very little towards adding
much to the picturesque for the benefit of
the traveller. Here and there is to be found
an exception, however, to this rule; portions
of the Erie railroad, and the whole of the
Hudson River, as well as that along the Rhine,
necessarily possessing the advantage of sharing
in the sublimity and grace through which
they pass. Time will, of course, remedy the
defects of the whole arrangement; and a new
front will be presented, as it may be, to the
traveller throughout the civilized world.
Whether human ingenuity will yet succeed
in inventing substitutes for the smoke and
other unpleasant appliances of a railroad train,
remains to be seen; but we think few will be
disposed to differ from us, when we say that
in our view of the matter this great improvement
of modern intercourse has done very
little towards the embellishment of a country
in the way of landscapes. The graceful winding
curvatures of the old highways, the acclivities
and declivities, the copses, meadows
and woods, the half-hidden church, nestling
among the leaves of its elms and pines, the
neat and secluded hamlet, the farm-house,
with all its comforts and sober arrangements,
so disposed as to greet the eye of the passenger,
will long be hopelessly looked for by him
who flies through those scenes, which, like a
picture placed in a false light, no longer reflects
the genius and skill of the artist.</p>

<p>The old world enjoys an advantage as regards
the picturesque and pleasing, in connection
with its towns, that is wholly unknown,
unless it may be in the way of exception,
among ourselves. The necessity, in the middle
ages, of building for defence, and the
want of artillery before the invention of gunpowder,
contributed to the construction of
military works for the protection of the towns
in Europe, that still remain, owing to their
durable materials, often producing some of
the finest effects that the imagination could
invent to embellish a picture. Nothing of
the sort, of course, is to be met with here,
for we have no castles, have never felt the
necessity of fortified towns, and had no existence
at the period when works of this nature
came within the ordinary appliances of
society. On the contrary, the utilitarian
spirit of the day labors to erase every inequality
from the surface of the American town,
substituting convenience for appearance. It
is probable there is no one who, in the end,
would not give a preference to these new
improvements for a permanent residence;
but it is not to be denied that so far as the
landscape is concerned, the customs of the
middle ages constructed much the most picturesque
and striking collections of human
habitations. Indeed, it is scarcely possible
for the mind to conceive of objects of this
nature, that are thrown together with finer
effects, than are to be met with among the
mountainous regions, in particular, of Europe.
We illustrate one or two that are to be met
with in the Apennines, and the Alps, and
even in Germany, as proofs of what we say.
The eye, of itself, will teach the reader,
that Richmond and Boston, and Washington
and Baltimore, and half-a-dozen other
American towns that do possess more or less
of an unequal surface, must yield the palm to
those gloriously beautiful objects of the old
world. When it is remembered, too, how
much time has multiplied these last, it can be
seen that there are large districts in the
mountain regions of the other hemisphere,
that enjoy this superiority over us, if superiority
it can be called, to possess the picturesque,
at the expense of the convenient. The
imagination can scarcely equal the pictures
of this nature that often meet the eye in the
southern countries of Europe. Villages, with
the chiselled outlines of castles, gray, sombre,
but distinct, are often seen, perched on the
summits of rocky heights, or adhering, as it
might be, to their sides, in situations that are
frequently even appalling, and which invariably
lend a character of peculiar beauty to
the view. There are parts of Europe in
which the traveller encounters these objects
in great numbers, and if an American, they
never fail to attract his attention, as the wigwam
and the bark canoe, and the prairie
with lines of bisons, would catch the eye of a
wayfarer from the old world. To these
humbler mountain pictures, must be added
many a castle and strong-hold, of royal or
semi-royal origin, that are met with on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
summits of abrupt and rocky eminences farther
north. Germany has many of these
strong-holds, which are kept up to the present
day, and which are found to be useful as
places of security, as they are certainly peculiar
and interesting in the landscape.</p>

<p>It has often been said by scientific writers,
that this country affords many signs of an
origin more recent than the surface of Europe.
The proofs cited are the greater depths of
the ravines wrought by the action of the waters
following the courses of the torrents, and
the greater and general aspect of antiquity
that is impressed on natural objects in the
other hemisphere. This theory, however,
has met with a distinguished opponent in our
own time. Without entering at all into the
merits of this controversy, we shall admit
that to the ordinary eye America generally is
impressed with an air of freshness, youthfulness,
and in many instances, to use a coarse
but expressive term, rawness, that are seldom,
if ever, met with in Europe. It might
perhaps be easy to account for this by the
labors of man, alone, though we think that
natural objects contribute their full share towards
deepening the picture. We know of
no mountain summits on this side of the Atlantic
that wear the hoary hues of hundreds
that are seen on the other side of the water;
and nearly everywhere in this country that
the eye rests on a mountain-top, it encounters
a rounded outline of no very decided
tints, unless, indeed, it may actually encounter
verdure. To our eye, this character
of youthfulness is very strongly perceptible
throughout those portions of the republic
with which we are personally acquainted,
and we say this without reference to the recent
settlements, which necessarily partake
of this character, but to the oldest and most
finished of our own landscapes. The banks of
the Hudson, for instance, have not the impress
of time as strongly marked on their
heights and headlands, and bays, and even
mountains, as the banks of the Rhine; and
we have often even fancied that this distinguishing
feature between the old and new
worlds is to be traced on nearly every object
of nature or art. Doubtless the latter has
been the principal agent in producing these
effects; but it is undeniable that they form a
leading point of distinction in the general
character of the scenery of the two continents.
As for England, it has a shorn and
shaven aspect that reminds one of the husbandman
in his Sunday's attire; for we have
seen that island in February, when, owing to
the great quantity of its grain and the prevalent
humidity of the atmosphere, it really appeared
to us to possess more verdure than it
did in the subsequent July and August.</p>

<p>There is one feature in European scenery,
generally, more prevalent, however, in Catholic
than in other countries, to which we
must allude before we close. The bourg, or
town, with its gray castellated outlines, and
possibly with walls of the middle ages, is, almost
invariably, clustered around the high,
pointed roofs and solemn towers of the
church. With us, how different is the effect!
Half a dozen ill-shaped, and yet pretending
cupolas, and other ambitious objects, half the
time in painted wood, just peer above the
village, while the most aspiring roof is almost
invariably that of the tavern. It may be
easy enough to account for this difference,
and to offer a sufficient apology for its existence.
But to the observant lover of the picturesque
the effect is not only unpleasant but
often repulsive. No one of ordinary liberality
would wish to interfere with freedom of
conscience in order to obtain fine landscapes;
but this is one of the hundred instances in
which the thoughtful man finds reason to regret
that the church, as it exists among us,
is not really more Catholic.</p>

<p>To conclude, we concede to Europe much
the noblest scenery, in its Alps, Pyrenees,
and Apennines; in its objects of art, as a
matter of course; in all those effects which
depend on time and association, in its monuments,
and in this impress of the past which
may be said to be reflected in its countenance;
while we claim for America the freshness
of a most promising youth, and a species
of natural radiance that carries the mind with
reverence to the source of all that is glorious
around us.</p>

<h2>A BULL FIGHT AT RONDA.</h2>


<p>The ride from Gibraltar to San Roque is
familiar to all the inhabitants of the rock,
and notwithstanding that the soil, the natives,
and their costume vary much from similar objects
in England, and that the plants and scenery
are totally of a foreign character, yet from
the number of English people on the road,
one finds it difficult to believe one's-self in
Spain until on the other side of San Roque.</p>

<p>This last small town is prettily situated on
a hill, about five miles from Gibraltar. On
passing the drawbridge which crosses the
ditch at the Landport point, we got on the
isthmus which traverses the inundation, situated
at the North Front of this isolated fortress,
and which is the only avenue of access
or egress. The approach to this is also guarded
by two strong outposts. The last of these,
called the old North Front, furnishes sentries
which guard the intermediate posts between
it and the Spanish lines. On arriving at the
end of the isthmus, we crossed a place which
is called the Neutral ground, and reached a
small village garrisoned by a wing of a Spanish
regiment, who are there stationed to intercept
smugglers. On leaving the village
there is no regular road, but those wishing to
proceed to Spain have to ride or walk by the
shore for a distance of about two miles, until
they reach a plain, which is crossed by a road
leading to a small village called Campo. This
place is often resorted to by the gentry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>
Gibraltar, who find it much cooler during
summer than their residences in the streets
of the town. After passing this village, which
had certainly little of interest about it, we
rode by a circuitous road, generally hedged
on each side by plants of the cactus and aloes,
and but little wooded, till we reached San
Roque.</p>

<p>Here we saw in miniature what may be
called a specimen of a Spanish town; the
windows at the lower story of the houses
barred with cages of iron called <i>regas</i>, which
completely obstruct all entrance by that
mode, rendering them in fact like jails. The
streets paved with large stones, quite dry,
and disposed so irregularly as to make them
the most disagreeable to ride in that I ever
witnessed. Then there was the small alameda,
with its walks, and trees quite neat
and regular; where the beauties of the rural
town paced with their mantillas and fans:
on the other side was a barrack, which contained
a Spanish regiment, who were drilling
and exercising when we arrived. These
were swarthy-looking fellows, mostly young
and undersized.</p>

<p>As we rode away from the town we descended
by a rugged stony road, which was
very rough, and in some places nearly precipitous.
Our party consisted of four officers
besides myself, two mules containing our
clothes and provisions, and a guide and servant
on horseback. We got packed up in
panniers all the loose beer and cold meat,
tea, coffee, sugar, biscuit, sausages, hams, and
other edibles which we should require for a
week's consumption, and did not find that
we had at all exceeded our computation, for
with the exception of eggs, fowls, milk, butter,
chocolate, and indifferent wine, we could
get nothing in the way of eating and drinking
at the different villages we stopped at.
Our cavalcade was consequently delayed very
much by being obliged to keep with the
mules. We went along this very rough and
rugged stony track, which could scarcely be
called a road, for about two miles; we then
crossed some hills. The country for about
three miles from San Roque was quite open.</p>

<p>Here it was that we arrived at a mountain
pass, which was very thickly planted on each
side with brushwood, shrubs, and fern. So
thick and impervious was the cover for those
who might choose to lie in ambush, that a
band of many men, at least amounting to sixty,
might have rested concealed quite close
to the path which we rode on. I am not
disposed to be credulous relative to stories
which travellers tell on the subject of hairbreadth
escapes and adventures; but, certainly
in this country, more than any in Europe,
there is presented a more continuous series
of scenes which one's fancy might suppose
calculated to be the resort of outlawed marauders
or wandering bandits. I had heard
numerous accounts of parties having been
waylaid, and of the danger consequent upon
travelling in Spain, and the disposition of the
country people is so prone to exaggerate, that
every day adds a fresh instance to the catalogue
of incidents which those who listen to
them hear recorded.</p>

<p>The nature of the scenery which we were
passing through was such as to recall to our
mind the spirited groups of Salvator Rosa's
coloring, or the sketches so graphically described
by Cervantes or Le Sage.</p>

<p>We had not ridden further than a few yards
when two men rushed from the cover with
their firelocks to their shoulders, and called
out "Alto, alto." Their action, their dress,
the tone which they used made me conclude
that they were bandits, and I rode up to one
of our party, the only one who was armed
(who carried a pair of pistols in his saddlebags),
and asked him to lend me one of them.
He had not time to answer before one of the
men approached me with his firelock to his
shoulder, and said, in Spanish, "I can hit a
sombrero at two hundred yards distance."
Another of our party advised me to answer
him civilly, for, he said, "I see four men from
different quarters who have their firelocks
levelled at you." On this I demanded of
him if he wanted money, or wished for something
to drink. He seemed more indignant
at this supposition, and informed us that he
and his party were carbineros or revenue
officers, who were stationed there to intercept
any smugglers who might be proceeding into
Spain. He said that he would be obliged in
any case to detain our mules, and that from
what I had said he should be obliged to keep
us prisoners until he heard from the Governor
at Algeciras. Then the rest of his party all
made their appearance, each of them armed
with firelock and pistols, and having with
them the mules belonging to one of the parties
of officers who had been going to Ronda.
After a deal of altercation, we rode back with
them and decided upon the plan of sending
two of our party to Algeciras to the Governor,
to ask him relative to the state of the case.
It was vexatious being delayed, but there
was no help for it.</p>

<p>When the two officers started we were
about twelve miles from Algeciras. We then
rode through a wild country much wooded
with shrubs, groves of oleanders, orange
groves, hedges of grapes, and other exotics,
which are so rare and so much prized at
home, and, crossing two rivers, we reached
the sea beach at some distance from Algeciras.
The mode of crossing the river was
by large movable boats which had pullies
attached to their frames on deck, and ropes
which were fastened to the beams on shore
at one end, and at the other to some leathern
thongs which the men fastened to their
shoulders, and towing them on board, soon
passed the boat over from one bank to the
other. When we were on the beach, the
leader of the party of carbineros fired his
piece at a gull which passed and wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
him, but the bird, who was hit in the wing,
rested on the water.</p>

<p>We did not ride far before our two friends
returned, and heartily welcome they were.
They produced a paper signed by the Governor,
a Spanish General at Algeciras, which
ordered our instant liberation; they said that
he was very indignant when he heard of our
capture. The leader of the party of carbineros
on this was satisfied, and gave up the pistols
which he had captured from the officer
who carried them, and bid us farewell. We
then had to ride to San Roque, and on our
way back, had much amusement in talking
over our adventure. I was certainly very
glad that we had offered no resistance to these
people; but had we left our mules in their
charge it would have been most inconvenient,
and in fact I think scarcely safe. The
party which preceded us had reason to be
very thankful, for by our means they obtained
safe carriage for their mules, which they
would not have seen for some days, had it
not been for our having come up with them.
So we were obliged to take up our quarters
for that night at the inn at San Roque, which
was a nice clean place, and kept by an Englishman
and his wife. It is altogether much
more like an English house in its accommodation
than a Spanish one, which, it is needless
to add, is speaking much in its praise. In
the evening at dinner the principal topic of
conversation was this adventure of ours, and
we heard some accounts of the modes of travelling
in Spain, and the direful amount of
smuggling which exists between its confines
and Gibraltar, from an old inhabitant of the
rock. He told us a story of his having been
stopped, and having his horse taken from
him, and being obliged to walk a number of
miles. He never saw the horse again, and
never heard a word of the robbers who stopped
him, and yet he said that it happened at
about six miles distance from San Roque.</p>

<p>The next morning the weather was certainly
beautiful, and numerous parties came
in from Gibraltar, to breakfast at San Roque,
previous to their long ride to Gaucin, a distance
of thirty miles. The merriment that
prevailed, the novelty of the expected scenes,
the beauty of the wild romantic country they
were about to enter, the good spirits and
freedom of manners of all, made every party
seem exhilarated and happy. Some were
dressed in the style of the Spanish Majos,
and armed with pistols and daggers. The
generality wore light jackets, sashes, and
trousers: also the sombrero was very much
in use. The Spanish masta, that most useful
appendage to a traveller's equipment, was
over most of the saddles. We were all enabled
to rest confident in the assurance of
not being molested or waylaid upon the road,
as, being the regular day for visitors to proceed
to Ronda, the authorities had posted
soldiers in different parts of the road. We
came up with and passed many groups of
Spaniards. The men were dressed with short
jackets, sometimes laced, and having a vast
number of small buttons, large red sash, leggings
with rows of buttons all the way down
on each side, and boltinas or leathern hose
worn open. They all wore the sombrero,
and most of them were armed with firelocks,
slung from their shoulders. The colored mantas,
as usual, were strapped on the saddles, in
order to render the riding easy, to serve as a
cloak in the event of rain, and to answer for
bed-clothes on their arrival at the Fonda,
where they were going to sleep. The ladies
of the Spanish parties were mounted either
on mules or barricos seated on cushions,
which were strapped on pads, placed on the
animals with two cross sticks on the shoulder
and two on its crupper. The ladies all
wore mantillas, and with the exception of
the number of petticoats which they invariably
wear, their dress did not vary much from
that of English country people. We passed
through a broken hilly country until we reached
the cork-wood&mdash;that forest which stretches
for about ten miles from east to west, a most
picturesque spot, composed principally of cork-trees
and some orange groves. At about ten
miles from San Roque we arrived at the Bocea
de Leones, that most dangerous pass,
where the country was wild and the scenery
romantic. There were stationed here some
Spanish cavalry who guarded the pass. They
were all fine able-bodied men, mounted on
strong black horses; they wore blue double-breasted
coats, buff belts, jack-boots, and
large cocked hats. Past the cork-wood the
country was broken and hilly, thickly planted
with shrubs and evergreens; reeds and
brushwood were also numerous. After this
we got into a valley which was well cultivated,
and the plantations lay thickly studded
with oleanders and wild roses, and we saw
frequently a white plant resembling the myrtle.
The grounds had a gay and fresh appearance.
When we were passing one of the
fields where the laborers were at work we
saw the curious manner in which the lower
order of Spaniards eat&mdash;their mess of <i>gaypacho</i>
was in a large bowl, which was placed
in the centre of a circle formed by about sixty
men, and each supplied with a spoon; they
then dipped the spoon into this capacious
bowl, one after another, in regular routine,
until the food was finished.</p>

<p>We crossed about twelve different streams
in going through this valley, and soon after
passing the last, we came to an orange grove,
through which the ride was agreeable. The
delicious fruit was in abundance, loading the
trees on each side of the way, when we arrived
at the foot of the hill on which Gaucin
is situated, and had an ascent of nearly three
miles, which was winding and rugged before
we reached the road leading into the town.
The difficulty of the road, the nearly impassable
ascent of the cliffs, the circuitous track
of the route, made it a matter of surprise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
us that a town such as this we were approaching
should have been built on a site where
the supply of almost any articles of merchandise
was so inconvenient. Groups of hundreds
of children lined the passes calling out
to us incessantly, "Oh tio om cherito." We
entered the town and were long before we
could accommodate ourselves with a night's
lodging, which however at last we managed
to procure at the private house of a man who
called himself a captain in the Spanish army.
It was very uncomfortable, although perhaps
the best that could be had in the town, and
they charged exorbitantly. The town is most
picturesquely situated upon a lofty height.
After our long ride, which was over such a
rough and broken country, we did not feel
much disposed to saunter about, but as the
evening was far advanced we stayed within
doors. We procured merely the means of
cooking, and milk, eggs, and fowl; but the
people made themselves very agreeable, and
we had great amusement and laughter. We
set off early the next morning and commenced
by descending the lofty mound upon which
the town is built, by as tortuous and harassing
a path as that by which we approached
it. However, after we had proceeded about
two miles a vista of as romantic and pleasing
a kind as any I had ever seen in any other
country opened before me. In the continuous
range of hills which lined the road, the
vineyards covered both the sides and tops for
several miles around, and the valleys in the
distance were thickly planted with chestnut
woods: further on, the vast range of the
ronda sierra lined the horizon.</p>

<p>The outline of these mountains was bold
and their scenery grand. Their sides and
summits were studded throughout with towns,
embosomed in the vast woods of chestnuts.
They loomed beautiful and picturesque in the
different intervals, and it wanted only water
to render it an Elysium upon earth. After
keeping this in view for several miles, and
through a narrow and precipitous track, we
came to a line of mountain scenery where
the hills were altogether barren, except where,
far down their sides, the corn fields were
planted, where the road was much worse.
We saw another town which went by the
name of Gaucin also, and had a large redoubt
to defend it, on its right flank; then the route
circled round the mountains towards Attogate.
We could not take our horses out of
a foot pace, and very often I dismounted to
lead mine down the craggy rocks. No horses
but those shod in the Spanish fashion could manage
to get through these descents. Towards
the entrance of Attogate it was rather more
uneven and dangerous, and I heard that one of
the horsemen of the party that preceded us
had been thrown. We passed through the
miserable village, which was as wretched as
any thing that I had ever seen even in Ireland,
and went on still by a mountain path, and
round by lofty hills, for about three miles. We
then got sight of a very spacious plain, like an
immense amphitheatre; to the west and to the
east were the ranges of the Ronda hills, and
to the north, as we approached, was a precipitous
cliff of about two thousand feet in
height, upon the summit of which was situated
the town of Ronda. This seemed at the
distance like a large perpendicular mass of
earth. From the first place where we viewed
it until our entrance to the town, the road
or path was even more rugged than that which
we traversed during most part of the day.</p>

<p>We entered the old town and passed the
remains of many Moorish ruins, through a
stony street, with houses built like most of
the Spanish ones, and came to a large bridge
which crossed a ravine through which the
river flows. This bridge is at a height of
about one thousand feet from the level of the
river. We then passed through the plaza and
came to the street where we found a lodging.
As the bull fights were not to commence until
four P.M., the next day, we had a little
leisure to look about us. In the streets all
the crowded shops showed that an unusual
influx of strangers had come to visit the place.
We saw some splendid houses; one I particularly
remarked, which belonged to the Marquis
de Salvittierra; its lofty gateway of stone
covered with devices and figures in alto-relievo,
reminded me, with the motto inscribed
over the summit of its arch, of the entrance
to an Eastern palace. My companion, who
was taking a sketch of it, after he had finished
his labor was standing with me admiring
this arch, which had evidently been the work
of the Saracen invaders, when we saw two
ladies in mantillas, both daughters of the late
Marquis, who were walking towards its entrance.
We told them in Spanish that we
were foreigners&mdash;Englishmen, who had come
to Ronda to visit it during the time of the
fair, and in place of being annoyed at our
seeming forwardness in thus addressing them,
they invited us into the house. We went
through corridors, futios, and up the staircase,
which was ornamented with some tolerable
paintings, and entered into one of the salas,
or large rooms. When we arrived the two
graceful girls, one of whom was about twenty
and the other about sixteen, stood with their
arms folded before them, and their head
slightly bowing. They had each large fans
in their hands. Their dress was stylish; their
slippers beautiful and small; their black lace
mantillas waving round their hair; their dress
completely of black, made their figures seem
elegant and their countenances interesting.
Their eyes had the deep languor of the southern
aspect, more than the playful loveliness
which frequently is seen with those of their
age. Their features were regular, and their
teeth, which they showed in smiling to us
when we entered, were of dazzling whiteness.
I recollected the Spanish words used in salutation,
viz.: "A los fies di usted mi senorita,"
and on hearing it in the foreign accent it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
great amusement to them, as they repeated it
from one to the other. We conversed on various
subjects relative to the town, the scenery,
the approaching feasts, the bull fights, and
after a little time took our leave, charmed
with their agreeable and pleasing conversation.
All the halls, corridors, and chambers
of this palace were adorned with pictures,
but the rooms were furnished rather scantily,
as seems the Spanish custom.</p>

<p>In the evening we went to the Alameda,
where we saw numerous groups of Spanish
beauties promenading. Certainly no female
figures which I have ever met with look better
than the Spanish women. Their walk
has been often noticed by different writers,
and yet I have never read any description
that does it justice. It is not the least like
the affected wriggling gait of the French women
or the frigid stride of the English, but a
light, graceful step combining elegance and
ease. They all seem to walk in the same way,
and as it forms a great part of their daily occupation,
it is no wonder that they should
excel in it. Their language of the fans is
another peculiarity of the country. I was
shown it by a lady; it is a series of signs by
which a lady lets the man who looks at her
know what her wishes are, either of disdain,
reproof, or encouragement, and is well known
and recognized. I should recommend every
gentleman who wishes to stay in the country
to learn it.</p>

<p>We met our two charming friends, the
Spanish Marquis's daughters, and walked with
them on the Alameda until it was dark. The
grounds are prettily laid out, and the view
from the western height which overlooks the
precipitous descent which I spoke of, viewed
from a distance, is truly superb. There the
winding stream and the country which bounds
it embrace the foot of the perpendicular declivity.</p>

<p>The next day we heard nothing but preparations
for the grand show, which was to
take place in a circus exactly opposite the lodging
we had got into. The Spanish cavalry,
dressed in yellow coats and large jack-boots,
lined the streets and played their band in
front of our windows. All orders and classes,
young and old, dressed in their gayest costume,
were seen going about the town. The
persons who lived in our house, who were a
Spanish officer and his family, all got tickets
of admission which we paid for. The box or
partition which we hired, we took in common
with the officers of another regiment,
who had also ridden over from Gibraltar to
witness the bull fights.</p>

<p>The arena when we entered was surrounded
by a concourse of about 1,500 people,
many of whom were ladies, but the majority
of the meaner orders. The amphitheatre or
plaza, as it is called by the Spaniards, was
about the same size as that at Milan. The
architecture had, however, no resemblance
to that of the Italian city. The diameter
was about 200 feet. Various writers
have noticed the interest which the Spaniards
take in these sights; and the multitude
which surrounded the amphitheatre, seated
either in the boxes or standing in the tiers,
which were level with the arena of combat,
all seemed eagerly expectant of the arrival of
the different actors in the scene.</p>

<p>About a quarter past four in the afternoon,
a trumpet sounded, and on the opening of
the side doors, five picadors entered, followed
at a few paces by three mules abreast,
drawing a pole like a swingle tree, with a
chain attached to it. They were mounted
each on a sorry, miserable hack-horse. They
were dressed in yellow jackets, covered with
beads of silver and all sorts of ornaments;
broad white sombreros, decked all round with
ribbons, yellow chamois leather trowsers, stuffed
out with cork and cotton, and coated inside
the leather with iron plates. After the mules
with their car, came the three matadors, in order.
Their dress was perfectly superb; it was
a close fitting majos dress, ornamented with
silver lacing and beading. The names of these
matadors were Montes, Espesa, and Ximenes.
The first wore a beautiful rose-colored tunic,
and his hair tied behind with ribbons, and
crimson-colored leggings, &amp;c. The dress of
the second was of the same form, only varying
in color, being all pink. The dress of the
third was also the same in cut, but of a black
color. These three, as well as the chulos,
wore silk stockings. The chulos followed
next in succession, and were dressed similar
to the matadors, but not so grandly. They,
as well as the matadors, all carried a large
cloth, of silk texture, which was either red,
blue, or yellow. The chulos were about five
in number. They all advanced across the
arena to where the Alcalde was seated, whilst
the trumpets sounded, and as soon as these
ceased to blow, the mules with their car left
the arena by the same door as that by which
they arrived, and the remainder of the procession
dispersed to the different parts of the
circus. After a lapse of two or three minutes,
the centre door opened, and a furious black
bull rushed in the most impetuous manner into
the circus, and charged the different picadors.
The first was not hurt, but the second and
third picador had their horses ripped open.
This was really a most revolting sight, for
even after these cruel inflictions upon the
poor horses, and when their entrails were
hanging out, the picadors who rode them
goaded them still onwards. The attendants
in the circus joined in this act of cruelty. I
do not think that Byron was far wrong in
saying of these sights&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Such the ungentle sport that oft invites<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Spanish maid and cheers the Spanish swain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nurtured in blood, betimes, his heart delights<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In vengeance, gloating on another's pain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fourth picador broke his spear in meeting
the rushing of this bull. The bull bled
much from this, and at the fifth charge he
ripped up another horse. I watched every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
turn of the "hearty fight," and noted it in
my tablet. Though not quite what I considered
in my English ideas as <i>sport</i>, yet it
was altogether so novel that I question if I
ever joined in a hunt which gave me greater interest.
It would, however, be extremely unjust
to make any comparison between our
manly sport and this cruel spectacle, or even
to mention them in the same breath.</p>

<p>The chulos now began at intervals to provoke
the bull by advancing towards him with
their colored cloaks spread, and urging him
to follow them. Their activity was most remarkable.
Whenever the bull approached
them close, they left their cloaks, and vaulted
up the partition. One of them, whom I
saw pressed quite close, jumped clean over
the bull's head, and many such feats of agility
we saw, both at this time and during the
whole of the exhibition. After several
efforts made to provoke him, the bull jumped
over the wooden partition which separated
the amphitheatre from the arena, a height of
about five feet, called by the Spaniards the
barrero. Of course this caused much terror
and sensation, as many were standing quite
close, and the rush was quite awful: however,
after running half round, he jumped
into the circus again. He then struck a picador,
leaped the inclosure, and stayed a shorter
time than at first, when he again jumped
out, after several attempts on the part of the
chulos to provoke him, and when he appeared
wearied and fainter from his exertions and
from the loss of blood.</p>

<p>On this the Alcalde caused the trumpets to
sound and the banderilleros came in, each carrying
two stakes about a yard long and
fringed with short flags. They ran close to
the animal, and plunged these stakes, called
banderillos, into the bull's shoulders. Four
of these were let fly and plunged into his
flesh, and the trumpets again sounded for the
matadors to stick him with a sword. Montes
undertook this bull, and drawing a long
sword, he stood before him until the bull got
near enough, when he stuck him between
the shoulders. The chulos provoked him a
second time, and Montes again wounded him.
The attack of the chulos was repeated, when
Montes planted his sword in the animal's
shoulder, but instantly withdrew it. Twice
more the chulos came to the attack, and on
each occasion the bull's shoulder was laid
open by Montes, but at the sixth onslaught,
the matador plunged his sword up to the hilt
in the mangled flesh, and the bull fell. Then
entered a man dressed like a chulo, with a
dagger called a puntilla, and which gave to
its owner the designation of a puntillero, and
struck it in the neck of the prostrate animal,
which immediately expired. When this was
ascertained, the mules who had formed part
of the opening procession, and had then withdrawn,
reappeared, and the carcase of the
bull was tied to the swingle tree, and dragged
out of the arena.</p>

<p>Seven other bulls were brought out in succession,
and attacked in the same manner,
with a little variation in the details. The
second bull charged two picadors, and did
them no damage, but in a third charge he
lamed a picador's horse, and received himself
a serious gash in the neck. At a fourth
charge he ripped open a horse's bowels, and
coming on for the fifth and sixth time, threw
the horse of another picador prostrate, and
when he was on the ground, dug his horns
into the bowels of the horse in a most frightful
manner. I was never more forcibly reminded
of Homer's description of the wolves,
who in their charge upon the flock, seize with
such fiendish fierceness "&#954;&#945;&#953; &#949;&#947;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#955;&#945;&#966;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#953;."</p>

<p>The matador who undertook the third bull
had but one eye, and, to render the combat
equal, one of the bull's eyes was blinded, an
expedient worthy of its cruel inventors. I
remarked nothing extraordinary about the
baiting or slaughter of this bull, except that
one of the chulos, in flying from him, had
his clothes torn off, and narrowly escaped
being gored.</p>

<p>The sixth bull was a very strong one. In
his charges he disabled two picadors, both of
whom were obliged to be removed from the
arena, and one was perfectly senseless. The
infuriated animal then charged a horse, which
he killed instantaneously. The mules which
I spoke of before, came in, and bore away
the horse's carcase. Meanwhile the third
matador, Ximenes, struck the bull with a
sword up to the hilt, and killed him. He got
his ear as a trophy, which he held up in triumph,
and was saluted with innumerable vivas
from the boxes of the Spanish Senoritas,
some of whom wore black, and some white
lace mantillas. "Lesa lo dey," also was
shouted loudly, meaning, let him have the
bull for his courage. As one of the classic
writers has it, it turned out "Vox populi
vox Dei," for the hero was awarded the prize.</p>

<p>The seventh bull was considered a slow
one by the audience, and they commenced
shouting out "fuego, fuego." So when the
banderilleros were directed to throw their arrows,
they fastened squibs and crackers in various
parts of the arrow or banderillo, and,
on their exploding, the frantic animal went
racing round the arena, goaded to madness
by the crackers, which continued to go off at
every step. This bull was given over to
Montes to kill, as a very difficult subject, and
the intrepid matador made one or two attempts
before he succeeded in closing with
him. The last time he plunged his sword between
his shoulders, and the bull dropped
dead.</p>

<p>The eighth bull was killed after two thrusts,
and then the large concourse of people flocked
into the circus, and shortly afterwards, it
being 7 o'clock, almost every one proceeded
on to the Alameda. Next morning, the bull
fights were resumed, and the sport, if I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
call it by so mild a name, was considered superior.
The matadors were differently dressed,
and I remarked that all the picadors' horses
were blindfolded. Montes, the first time of
their contact, drove his sword into the neck
of the first bull, a remarkably fine and very
fierce animal, and it died in a few seconds afterwards.
Four other bulls followed in order,
and were all overcome. But the contest of
the day was with the sixth bull. This savage
animal killed a horse at his first charge. He
then flew at another, and gored its sides in a
frightful manner, completely lifting the rider
off its back. The unfortunate picador was
carried out, apparently dead. The bull then
broke a horse's forearm, and charging another,
ripped it open, though its rider escaped,
and, being mounted afresh, behaved in the
most heroic way, proving, himself, in fact,
quite the lion of the day, whose feats excited
the wonder and the applause of the multitude.
He approached the box where we
were seated, and threw his hat down. Showers
of gold and dollars, amounting I should
think to about 80, rewarded his compliments
"a los Engless." He acknowledged this, by
saying that our kindness should be always
remembered. This bull was tormented a
long time, and certainly the cruelty exhibited
was most repulsive. The people quite exulted
in the way they drew out the barbed
darts from the creature's back, and thrust
them in again, in every way that could torture
him most. He was, however, at last
killed by Montes, after a number of thrusts.
After he had been struck the third time by
Montes, the blood gushed out from his mouth
in torrents, and in about seven seconds he
died. In the baiting of the eighth bull, the
same picador showed his dexterity. In the
third charge which he made, he killed a horse.
At first he brought the horse to the ground,
and rolled him over as he would a cat; then,
having dug his horns into his bowels for some
time, at last left him for dead. Two other
bulls followed, and with the death of the last,
the spectacle terminated.</p>

<p>The third day was appropriated to the exhibition
of the first rudiments of bull-fighting,
and was a regular gala for the more
youthful portion of the community. There
is no parallel to this practice at present existing
in any part of Europe. The prize-fighting
which till lately prevailed in England, independent
of the heartiness, and emulative
courage of the combatants, was a barbarism
of quite another kind, the excitement of
which was enhanced by the scope it allowed
for gambling. But in bull-fighting there is no
chance of making money, nor are wagers ever
laid upon the combatants. The spectacle,
in fact, is more like the games that took place
in imperial Rome, which argue a brutality of
feeling worthy of those degraded and sensual
times.</p>

<p>The third day there were no matadors, picadors,
or chulos, but to the youthful part of
the populace, it was one of the most pleasant.
The bulls were allowed to enter, and were
chased here and there by the populace with
sticks. There was a good deal of childish
folly and mountebank frivolity in these exhibitions.
After the bull had been tormented
for about twenty minutes, he was allowed to
leave the circus, and they brought in a large
tame one, with a bell round his neck, who
was followed immediately by the young ones.
One of the small bulls who was baited in
this way, jumped over the barrier; but being
much worried, soon jumped back.</p>

<p>The people moved about the circus, laughing
and running, and seemed like schoolboys
just allowed out to play, after the hours of
study were finished. It seemed to me that
the reputed gravity of the Spaniards did not
at all extend to the lower orders, or to the
women, whose mirth, animation, and playfulness
of manner are very striking. The
third bull was killed, and this one was the
only sacrifice to the sanguinary tastes of the
people.</p>

<p>Two large, high, basket-like gabions were
afterwards brought in, when two men entered
them up to the arms, and it was great
diversion to the people to see the bulls, who
were successively led into the arena, and
whose horns were covered with leather,
tossing these baskets about. The men who
were inside had got banderillos, which they
stuck in the bull's back when he came up to
them. This lasted for some time, but at last
the crowd grew weary of it, and dispersed.</p>

<p>On this day, Charpur (who certainly was
the hero of the play), exhibited his dexterity
as a chulos in the scene where the bull killing
took place. One of the novices, who
was being educated as a matador, drove his
sword through the bull's neck, up to the hilt,
transfixing a portion of the flesh, and leaving
the blade dangling from it. Charpur
went up to the bull, and, partly by his cloak
and partly by his menaces, led him towards
the barrera, when he seized hold of his tail,
and holding on by his back, approached his
neck, and coolly took the sword out, which
he threw on the ground.</p>

<p>Such is the recreation, and such the feats,
which are the theme of praise and topic of
conversation amongst the Spanish people, who
discourse of it as we do of the races at Ascot
or Newmarket, or any other resort of the
men on the turf. But I certainly did not see
one English lady there, notwithstanding the
numbers of Spanish mantillas which might
have kept them in countenance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet are Spain's maids no race of Amazons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But formed for all the witching arts of love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In softness and in firmness far above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remoter females, famed for sickening prate."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This, by what I can learn, is the only remnant
of the ancient fights which the Goths
must have learned from the Romans; cruel
and barbarous exhibitions, much "more honored
in the breach than in the observance."</p>

<p>The next day we passed in walking about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
the town. We entered a church, which was
built of soft granite, and the internal structure
of which reminded me of some that I had
seen in Florence and Milan. The arches were
Gothic; the columns that supported the cupolas
inside, and the different domes into
which the aisle was divided, were massive
and grand. The paintings seemed not to be
from the hands of masters; and the altars,
which at a distance seemed so gorgeous, had
rather a tinsel glittering sort of appearance on
near approach, such as would be called familiarly
"gingerbread shows"&mdash;but it was
very lofty and extensive.</p>

<p>We went next to see the old Moorish palace.
Here a staircase, very much dilapidated,
led from the interior to the edge of the small
river which runs through the whole of Ronda.
The town being divided by a very deep
ravine, at the bottom of which the river flows,
and which is crossed by three bridges. Down
this staircase, damp, gloomy, and intricate as
it was, we descended, and a guide preceded
us with a candle, which, however, scarcely
gave us light enough to see our way down
the dark and slippery descent. It was constructed,
according to the instruction of our
cicerone, in the year 800, by one of the Moorish
kings, who had it built for the purpose of
supplying his palace with water. At the foot
of it we came to a sort of window, which going
through, we stepped out by the river's
side. I ought to mention that at intervals
we passed the remains of large chambers and
other vaulted apartments, which must evidently
have been prisons as dark and loathsome
as any which Mrs. Radcliffe, or any other
horror-loving romancer, could draw from a
morbid imagination. We had to return the
same way.</p>

<p>Quitting the palace, we passed through the
part of the town which leads by the Marquis
of Salvatierras' house, and went on to the
fountain, which springs from the solid rock
in the midst of the ravine. We then returned
homewards. In the evening our fair hostess
amused us with singing, dancing, and
conversation. One night we had a party of
Gipsies, or, as they are called, Rectanos, to
dance. They are a curious set of beings, and
their habits are as strange as their appearance.
They, to me, were very plain, and of a brown
color; the men very dark, with long matted
beards. They danced the fandangoe, in which
a man and woman get up, and moving castanets
with their hands, performed such evolutions
as, to speak in the mildest way, would
greatly astonish English spectators. I was
much disappointed with it, as I saw nothing
graceful in their movements. All the time
they were figuring and lifting their limbs, the
party seated kept time with their castanets.
At intervals they sang when they were dancing,
which reminded me of the nautch-girls
in India. They would drink nothing except
Rosaria, a sort of stuff distilled from limes,
partaking, however, of sweetmeats which
were handed round to them, and which they
relished so much, that they had a scramble
for them. The dress of the women was very
gaudy, and of various colors.</p>

<p>I did not think much of these people, but
I like what I have seen of the Spanish ladies
very much. Their manners are lively, unaffected,
and pleasing. The night after this,
we went to a party which was given by some
officers of another regiment. Here again I
had an opportunity of seeing the manners of
the Spanish ladies, which were certainly very
pleasing.</p>

<p>The next day at 11, we once more mounted
our horses, and bidding adieu to our fair
hostess, we left the town, the beauties of
which have been amply dilated upon by different
writers. We pursued the same route
as that by which we came, and arrived at
Gibraltar a few minutes after the evening gun
gave notice of the time to shut the gates of
the fortress.</p>




<p class="center">From Chamber's Edinburgh Journal.</p>

<h2>VAGARIES OF THE IMAGINATION.</h2>


<p>"Fancy it burgundy," said Boniface of
his ale&mdash;"only fancy it, and it is worth
a guinea a quart!" Boniface was a philosopher:
fancy can do much more than that.
Those who fancy themselves laboring under
an affection of the heart are not slow in verifying
the apprehension: the uneasy and
constant watching of its pulsations soon disturbs
the circulation, and malady may ensue
beyond the power of medicine. Some physicians
believe that inflammation can be induced
in any part of the body by a fearful
attention being continually directed towards
it; indeed it has been a question with some
whether the stigmata (the marks of the
wounds of our Saviour) may not have been
produced on the devotee by the influences of
an excited imagination. The hypochondriac
has been known to expire when forced to
pass through a door which he fancied too
narrow to admit his person. The story of
the criminal who, unconscious of the arrival
of the reprieve, died under the stroke of a
wet handkerchief, believing it to be the axe,
is well known. Paracelsus held, "that there
is in man an imagination which really affects
and brings to pass the things that did not before
exist; for a man by imagination willing
to move his body moves it in fact, and by his
imagination and the commerce of invisible
powers he may also move another body."
Paracelsus would not have been surprised at
the feats of electro-biology. He exhorts his
patients to have "a good faith, a strong imagination,
and they shall find the effects."
"All doubt," he says, "destroys work, and
leaves it imperfect in the wise designs of nature:
it is from faith that imagination draws
its strength, it is by faith it becomes complete
and realized; he who believeth in nature
will obtain from nature to the extent of his
faith, and let the object of this faith be real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
or imaginary, he nevertheless reaps similar
results&mdash;and hence the cause of superstition."</p>

<p>So early as 1462 Pomponatus of Mantua
came to the conclusion, in his work on incantation,
that all the arts of sorcery and witchcraft
were the result of natural operations.
He conceived that it was not improbable that
external means, called into action by the soul,
might relieve our sufferings, and that there
did, moreover, exist individuals endowed with
salutary properties; so it might, therefore,
be easily conceived that marvellous effects
should be produced by the imagination and
by confidence, more especially when these
are reciprocal between the patient and the
person who assists his recovery. Two years
after, the same opinion was advanced by
Agrippa in Cologne. "The soul," he said,
"if inflamed by a fervent imagination, could
dispense health and disease, not only in the
individual himself, but in other bodies." However
absurd these opinions may have been
considered, or looked on as enthusiastic, the
time has come when they will be gravely examined.</p>

<p>That medical professors have at all times
believed the imagination to possess a strange
and powerful influence over mind and body
is proved by their writings, by some of their
prescriptions, and by their oft-repeated direction
in the sick-chamber to divert the patient's
mind from dwelling on his own state
and from attending to the symptoms of his
complaint. They consider the reading of
medical books which accurately describe the
symptoms of various complaints as likely to
have an injurious effect, not only on the delicate
but on persons in full health; and they
are conscious how many died during the time
of the plague and the cholera, not only of
these diseases but from the dread of them,
which brought on all the fatal symptoms.
So evident was the effect produced by the
detailed accounts of the cholera in the public
papers in the year 1849, that it was found
absolutely necessary to restrain the publications
on the subject. The illusions under
which vast numbers acted and suffered have
gone, indeed, to the most extravagant extent;
individuals, not merely single but in communities,
have actually believed in their own
transformation. A nobleman of the court
of Louis XIV. fancied himself a dog, and
would pop his head out of the window to
bark at the passengers; while the barking
disease at the camp-meetings of the Methodists
of North America has been described
as "extravagant beyond belief." Rollin and
Hecquet have recorded a malady by which
the inmates of an extensive convent near
Paris were attacked simultaneously every
day at the same hour, when they believed
themselves transformed into cats, and a universal
mewing was kept up throughout the
convent for some hours. But of all dreadful
forms which this strange hallucination
took, none was so terrible as that of the lycanthropy,
which at one period spread
through Europe; in which the unhappy sufferers,
believing themselves wolves, went
prowling round the forests uttering the most
terrific howlings, carrying off lambs from the
flocks, and gnawing dead bodies in their
graves.</p>

<p>While every day's experience adds some
new proof of the influence possessed by the
imagination over the body, the supposed effect
of contagion has become a question of
doubt. Lately, at a meeting in Edinburgh,
Professor Dick gave it as his opinion that
there was no such thing as hydrophobia in
the lower animals: "what went properly by
that name was simply an inflammation of
the brain; and the disease, in the case of human
beings, was caused by an over-excited
imagination, worked upon by the popular
delusion on the effects of a bite by rabid animals."
The following paragraph from the
"Curiosities of Medicine" appears to justify
this now common enough opinion:&mdash;"Several
persons had been bitten by a rabid dog
in the Faubourg St. Antoine, and three of
them had died in our hospital. A report,
however, was prevalent that we kept a mixture
which would effectually prevent their
fatal termination; and no less than six applicants
who had been bitten were served with
a draught of colored water, and in no one
instance did hydrophobia ensue."</p>

<p>A remarkable cure through a similar aid
of the imagination took place in a patient of
Dr. Beddoes, who was at that time very sanguine
about the effect of nitrous acid gas in
paralytic cases. Anxious that it should be
imbibed by one of his patients, he sent an
invalid to Sir Humphry Davy, with a request
that he would administer the gas. Sir
Humphry put the bulb of the thermometer
under the tongue of the paralytic, to ascertain
the temperature of the body, that he
might be sure whether it would be affected
at all by the inhalation of the gas. The patient,
full of faith from what the enthusiastic physician
had assured him would be the result,
and believing that the thermometer was
what was to effect the cure, exclaimed at
once that he felt better. Sir Humphry, anxious
to see what imagination would do in
such a case, did not attempt to undeceive the
man, but saying that he had done enough for
him that day, desired him to be with him the
next morning. The thermometer was then
applied as it had been the day before, and for
every day during a fortnight&mdash;at the end of
which time the patient was perfectly cured.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is nothing on record more
curious of this kind than the cures unwittingly
performed by Chief-Justice Holt. It
seems that for a youthful frolic he and his
companions had put up at a country inn;
they, however, found themselves without the
means of defraying their expenses, and were
at a loss to know what they should do in such
an emergency. Holt, however, perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>
that the innkeeper's daughter looked very
ill, and on inquiring what was the matter,
learned that she had the ague; when, passing
himself off for a medical student, he said that
he had an infallible cure for the complaint.
He then collected a number of plants, mixed
them up with various ceremonies, and inclosed
them in parchment, on which he
scrawled divers cabalistic characters. When
all was completed, he suspended the amulet
round the neck of the young woman, and,
strange to say, the ague left her and never
returned. The landlord, grateful for the restoration
of his daughter, not only declined
receiving any payment from the youths, but
pressed them to remain as long as they
pleased. Many years after, when Holt was
on the bench, a woman was brought before
him, charged with witchcraft: she was accused
of curing the ague by charms. All
she said in defence was, that she did possess
a ball which was a sovereign remedy in the
complaint. The charm was produced and
handed to the judge, who recognized the very
ball which he had himself compounded in his
boyish days, when out of mere fun he had assumed
the character of a medical practitioner.</p>

<p>Many distinguished physicians have candidly
confessed that they preferred confidence
to art. Faith in the remedy is often not only
half the cure, but the whole cure. Madame
de Genlis tells of a girl who had lost the use
of her leg for five years, and could only move
with the help of crutches, while her back
had to be supported: she was in such a pitiable
state of weakness, the physicians had
pronounced her case incurable. She, however,
took it into her head that if she was
taken to Notre Dame de Liesse she would
certainly recover. It was fifteen leagues from
Carlepont where she lived. She was placed
in the cart which her father drove, while her
sister sat by her supporting her back. The
moment the steeple of Notre Dame de Liesse
was in sight she uttered an exclamation, and
said that her leg was getting well. She
alighted from the car without assistance, and
no longer requiring the help of crutches, she
ran into the church. When she returned
home the villagers gathered about her,
scarcely believing that it was indeed the girl
who had left them in such a wretched state,
now they saw her running and bounding
along, no longer a cripple, but as active as
any among them.</p>

<p>Not less extraordinary are the cures which
are effected by some sudden agitation. An
alarm of fire has been known to restore a
patient entirely, or for a time, from a tedious
illness: it is no uncommon thing to hear of
the victim of a severe fit of the gout, whose
feet have been utterly powerless, running
nimbly away from some approaching danger.
Poor Grimaldi in his declining years had almost
quite lost the use of his limbs owing to
the most hopeless debility. As he sat one day
by the bedside of his wife, who was ill, word
was brought to him that a friend waited below
to see him. He got down to the parlor
with extreme difficulty. His friend was
the bearer of heavy news which he dreaded
to communicate: it was the death of Grimaldi's
son, who, though reckless and worthless,
was fondly loved by the poor father.
The intelligence was broken as gently as such
a sad event could be: but in an instant Grimaldi
sprung from his chair&mdash;his lassitude and
debility were gone, his breathing, which had
for a long time been difficult, became perfectly
easy&mdash;he was hardly a moment in
bounding up the stairs which but a quarter of
an hour before he had passed with extreme difficulty
in ten minutes; he reached the bedside,
and told his wife that their son was
dead; and as she burst into an agony of grief
he flung himself into a chair, and became
instantaneously, as it has been touchingly
described, "an enfeebled and crippled old
man."</p>

<p>The imagination, which is remarkable for
its ungovernable influence, comes into action
on some occasions periodically with the most
precise regularity. A friend once told us of
a young relation who was subject to nervous
attacks: she was spending some time at the
seaside for change of air, but the evening-gun,
fired from the vessel in the bay at eight
o'clock, was always the signal for a nervous
attack: the instant the report was heard she
fell back insensible, as if she had been shot.
Those about her endeavored if possible to
withdraw her thoughts from the expected
moment: at length one evening they succeeded,
and while she was engaged in an interesting
conversation the evening-gun was
unnoticed. By and by she asked the hour,
and appeared uneasy when she found the
time had passed. The next evening it was
evident that she would not let her attention
be withdrawn: the gun fired, and she swooned
away; and when revived, another fainting
fit succeeded, as if it were to make up
for the omission of the preceding evening!
It is told of the great tragic actress Clairon,
who had been the innocent cause of the suicide
of a man who destroyed himself by a
pistol-shot, that ever after, at the exact moment
when the fatal deed had been perpetrated&mdash;one
o'clock in the morning&mdash;she
heard the shot. If asleep, it awakened her;
if engaged in conversation, it interrupted
her; in solitude or in company, at home or
travelling, in the midst of revelry or at her
devotions, she was sure to hear it to the very
moment.</p>

<p>The same indelible impression has been
made in hundreds of cases, and on persons
of every variety of temperament and every
pursuit, whether engaged in business, science
or art, or rapt in holy contemplation. On
one occasion Pascal had been thrown down
on a bridge which had no parapet, and his
imagination was so haunted for ever after by
the danger, that he always fancied himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>
on the brink of a steep precipice overhanging
an abyss ready to ingulf him. This illusion
had taken such possession of his mind
that the friends who came to converse with
him were obliged to place the chairs on
which they seated themselves between him
and the fancied danger. But the effects of
terror are the best known of all the vagaries
of the imagination.</p>

<p>A very remarkable case of the influence
of imagination occurred between sixty and
seventy years since in Dublin, connected with
the celebrated frolics of Dalkey Island. It
is said Curran and his gay companions delighted
to spend a day there, and that with
them originated the frolic of electing "a king
of Dalkey and the adjacent islands," and appointing
his chancellor and all the officers
of state. A man in the middle rank of
life, universally respected, and remarkable
alike for kindly and generous feelings and
a convivial spirit, was unanimously elected
to fill the throne. He entered with his
whole heart into all the humors of the
pastime, in which the citizens of Dublin so
long delighted. A journal was kept, called
the "Dalkey Gazette," in which all public
proceedings were inserted, and it afforded
great amusement to its conductors. But the
mock pageantry, the affected loyalty, and the
pretended homage of his subjects, at length
began to excite the imagination of "King
John," as he was called. Fiction at length
became with him reality, and he fancied himself
"every inch a king." His family and
friends perceived with dismay and deep sorrow
the strange delusion which nothing could
shake: he would speak on no subject save
the kingdom of Dalkey and its government,
and he loved to dwell on the various projects
he had in contemplation for the benefit of his
people, and boasted of his high prerogative:
he never could conceive himself divested for
one moment of his royal powers, and exacted
the most profound deference to his kingly authority.
The last year and a half of his life
were spent in Swift's hospital for lunatics.
He felt his last hours approaching, but no
gleam of returning reason marked the parting
scene: to the very last instant he believed
himself a king, and all his cares and anxieties
were for his people. He spoke in high
terms of his chancellor, his attorney-general,
and all his officers of state, and of the dignitaries
of the church: he recommended them
to his kingdom, and trusted they might all retain
the high offices which they now held.
He spoke on the subject with a dignified calmness
well becoming the solemn leave-taking
of a monarch; but when he came to speak
of the crown he was about to relinquish for
ever, his feelings were quite overcome, and
the tears rolled down his cheeks: "I leave it,"
said he, "to my people, and to him whom
they may elect as my successor!" This remarkable
scene is recorded in some of the notices
of deaths for the year 1788. The delusion,
though most painful to his friends, was
far from an unhappy one to its victim: his
feelings were gratified to the last while thinking
he was occupied with the good of his fellow-creatures&mdash;an
occupation best suited to
his benevolent disposition.</p>




<p class="center">From Household Words.</p>

<h2>THE FRENCH FLOWER GIRL.</h2>


<p>I was lingering listlessly over a cup of
coffee on the Boulevard des Italiens, in
June. At that moment I had neither profound
nor useful resources of thought. I sat
simply conscious of the cool air, the blue sky,
the white houses, the lights, and the lions,
which combine to render that universally
pleasant period known as "after dinner," so
peculiarly agreeable in Paris.</p>

<p>In this mood my eyes fell upon a pair of
orbs fixed intently upon me. Whether the
process was effected by the eyes, or by some
pretty little fingers, simply, I cannot say; but,
at the same moment, a rose was insinuated
into my button-hole, a gentle voice addressed
me, and I beheld, in connection with the
eyes, the fingers, and the voice, a girl. She
carried on her arm a basket of flowers, and
was, literally, nothing more nor less than one
of the <i>Bouqueti&egrave;res</i> who fly along the Boulevards
like butterflies, with the difference that
they turn their favorite flowers to a more
practical account.</p>

<p>Following the example of some other distracted
<i>d&eacute;cor&eacute;s</i>, who I found were sharing
my honors, I placed a piece of money&mdash;I believe,
in my case, it was silver&mdash;in the hand
of the girl; and, receiving about five hundred
times its value, in the shape of a smile and a
"<i>Merci bien Monsieur!</i>" was again left alone&mdash;("desolate,"
a Frenchman would have said)&mdash;in
the crowded and carousing Boulevard.</p>

<p>To meet a perambulating and persuasive
<i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i> who places a flower in your
coat and waits for a pecuniary acknowledgment,
is scarcely a rare adventure in Paris;
but I was interested&mdash;unaccountably so&mdash;in
this young girl: her whole manner and bearing
was so different and distinct from all
others of her calling. Without any of that
appearance which, in England, we are accustomed
to call "theatrical," she was such a
being as we can scarcely believe in out of
a ballet. Not, however, that her attire departed&mdash;except,
perhaps, in a certain coquettish
simplicity&mdash;from the conventional mode:
its only decorations seemed to be ribbons,
which also gave a character to the little cap
that perched itself with such apparent insecurity
upon her head. Living a life that
seemed one long summer's day&mdash;one floral
<i>f&ecirc;te</i>&mdash;with a means of existence that seemed
so frail and immaterial&mdash;she conveyed an
impression of <i>unreality</i>. She might be likened
to a Nymph, or a Naiad, but for the certain
something that brought you back to the theatre,
intoxicating the senses, at once, with the
strange, indescribable fascinations of hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span>
chandeliers&mdash;close and perfumed air&mdash;footlights,
and fiddlers.</p>

<p>Evening after evening I saw the same girl&mdash;generally
at the same place&mdash;and, it may
be readily imagined, became one of the most
constant of her <i>clientelle</i>. I learned, too, as
many facts relating to her as could be learned
where most was mystery. Her peculiar and
persuasive mode of disposing of her flowers
(a mode which has since become worse than
vulgarized by bad imitators) was originally
her own graceful instinct&mdash;or whim, if you
will. It was something new and natural, and
amused many, while it displeased none. The
sternest of stockbrokers, even, could not
choose but be decorated. Accordingly, this
new Nydia of Thessaly went out with her
basket one day, awoke next morning, and
found herself famous.</p>

<p>Meantime there was much discussion, and
more mystification, as to who this Queen of
Flowers could be&mdash;where she lived&mdash;and so
forth. Nothing was known of her except her
name&mdash;Hermance. More than one adventurous
student&mdash;you may guess I am stating
the number within bounds&mdash;traced her steps
for hour after hour, till night set in&mdash;in vain.
Her flowers disposed of, she was generally
joined by an old man, respectably clad, whose
arm she took with a certain confidence, that
sufficiently marked him as a parent or protector;
and the two always contrived sooner
or later, in some mysterious manner, to disappear.</p>

<p>After all stratagems have failed, it generally
occurs to people to ask a direct question. But
this in the present case was impossible. Hermance
was never seen except in very public
places&mdash;often in crowds&mdash;and to exchange
twenty consecutive words with her, was considered
a most fortunate feat. Notwithstanding,
too, her strange, wild way of gaining her
livelihood, there was a certain dignity in her
manner which sufficed to cool the too curious.</p>

<p>As for the directors of the theatres, they
exhibited a most appropriate amount of madness
on her account; and I believe that at
several of the theatres, Hermance might have
commanded her own terms. But only one of
these miserable men succeeded in making a
tangible proposal, and he was treated with
most glorious contempt. There was, indeed,
something doubly dramatic in the <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re's</i>
disdain of the drama. She who <i>lived</i> a
romance could never descend to act one. She
would rather be Rosalind than Rachel. She
refused the part of Cerito, and chose to be an
Alma on her own account.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that where there was
so much mystery, imagination would not be
idle. To have believed all the conflicting
stories about Hermance, would be to come to
the conclusion that she was the stolen child
of noble parents, brought up by an <i>ouvrier</i>;
but that somehow her father was a tailor of
dissolute habits, who lived a contented life of
continual drunkenness, on the profits of his
daughter's industry;&mdash;that her mother was a
deceased duchess&mdash;but, on the other hand,
as alive, and carried on the flourishing business
of a <i>blanchisseuse</i>. As for the private
life of the young lady herself, it was reflected
in such a magic mirror of such contradictory
impossibilities, in the delicate discussion held
upon the subject, that one had no choice but
disbelieve every thing.</p>

<p>One day a new impulse was given to this
gossip by the appearance of the <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i>
in a startling hat of some expensive straw,
and of a make bordering on the ostentatious.
It could not be doubted that the profits of
her light labors were sufficient to enable her
to multiply such finery to almost any extent,
had she chosen; but in Paris the adoption of
a bonnet or a hat, in contradistinction to the
little cap of the <i>grisette</i>, is considered an assumption
of a superior grade, and unless warranted
by the "position" of the wearer, is
resented as an impertinence. In Paris, indeed,
there are only two classes of women&mdash;those
with bonnets and those without; and
these stand in the same relation to one another,
as the two great classes into which the
world may be divided&mdash;the powers that be,
and the powers that want to be. Under
these circumstances, it may be supposed that
the surmises were many and marvellous.
The little <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i> was becoming proud&mdash;becoming
a lady;&mdash;but how? why? and
above all&mdash;where? Curiosity was never more
rampant, and scandal never more inventive.</p>

<p>For my part, I saw nothing in any of these
appearances worthy, in themselves, of a second
thought; nothing could have destroyed
the strong and strange interest which I had
taken in the girl; and it would have required
something more potent than a straw hat&mdash;however
coquettish in crown, and audacious
in brim&mdash;to have shaken my belief in her
truth and goodness. Her presence, for the
accustomed few minutes, in the afternoon or
evening, became to me&mdash;I will not say a necessity,
but certainly a habit; and a habit is
sufficiently despotic when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A fair face and a tender voice have made me"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I will not say "mad and blind," as the remainder
of the line would insinuate&mdash;but
most deliciously in my senses, and most luxuriously
wide awake! But to come to the
catastrophe&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One morn we missed <i>her</i> in the accustomed spot"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not only, indeed, from "accustomed" and
probable spots, but from unaccustomed, improbable,
and even impossible spots&mdash;all of
which were duly searched&mdash;was she missed.
In short, she was not to be found at all. All
was amazement on the Boulevards. Hardened
old <i>flaneurs</i> turned pale under their
rouge, and some of the younger ones went
about with drooping moustaches, which, for
want of the <i>cire</i>, had fallen into the "yellow
leaf."</p>

<p>A few days sufficed, however, for the cure
of these sentimentalists. A clever little monkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span>
at the Hippodrome, and a gentleman who
stood on his head while he ate his dinner,
became the immediate objects of interest, and
Hermance seemed to be forgotten. I was
one of the few who retained any hope of finding
her, and my wanderings for that purpose,
without any guide, clue, information, or indication,
seem to me now something absurd.
In the course of my walks, I met an old man,
who was pointed out to me as her father&mdash;met
him frequently, alone. The expression
of his face was quite sufficient to assure me
that he was on the same mission&mdash;and with
about as much chance of success as myself.
Once I tried to speak to him; but he turned
aside, and avoided me with a manner that
there could be no mistaking. This surprised
me, for I had no reason to suppose that he
had ever seen my face before.</p>

<p>A paragraph in one of the newspapers at
last threw some light on the matter. The
<i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i> had never been so friendless or
unprotected as people had supposed. In all
her wanderings she was accompanied, or
rather followed, by her father; whenever she
stopped, then he stopped also; and never was
he distant more than a dozen yards. I wonder
that he was not recognised by hundreds, but
I conclude he made some change in his attire
or appearance, from time to time. One
morning this strange pair were proceeding
on their ramble as usual, when passing
through a rather secluded street, the <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i>
made a sudden bound from the pavement,
sprung into a post-chaise, the door of
which stood open, and was immediately
whirled away, as fast as four horses could
tear&mdash;leaving the old man alone with his despair,
and the basket of flowers.</p>

<p>Three months have passed away since the
disappearance of the <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i>; but only a
few days since I found myself one evening
very dull at one of those "brilliant receptions,"
for which Paris is so famous. I was
making for the door, with a view to an early
departure, when my hostess detained me, for
the purpose of presenting to me a lady who
was monopolizing all the admiration of the
evening&mdash;she was the newly-married bride of
a young German Baron of great wealth, and
noted for a certain wild kind of genius, and
utter scorn of conventionalities. The next
instant I found myself introduced to a pair of
eyes that could never be mistaken. I dropped
into a vacant chair by their side, and entered
into conversation. The Baronne observed
that she had met me before, but could not remember
where, and in the same breath asked
me if I was a lover of flowers.</p>

<p>I muttered something about loving beauty
in any shape, and admired a bouquet which
she held in her hand.</p>

<p>The Baronne selected a flower, and asked
me if it was not a peculiarly fine specimen.
I assented; and the flower, not being redemanded,
I did not return it. The conversation
changed to other subjects, and shortly
afterwards the Baronne took her leave with
her husband. They left Paris next day for
the Baron's family estate, and I have never
seen them since.</p>

<p>I learned subsequently that some strange
stories had obtained circulation respecting the
previous life of the Baronne. Whatever they
were, it is very certain that this or some other
reason has made the profession of <i>Bouqueti&egrave;re</i>
most inconveniently popular in Paris. Young
ladies of all ages that can, with any degree of
courtesy, be included in that category, and of
all degrees of beauty short of the hunch-back,
may be seen in all directions intruding their
flowers with fatal pertinacity upon inoffensive
loungers, and making war upon button-holes
that never did them any harm. The youngest
of young girls, I find, are being trained to
the calling, who are all destined, I suppose,
to marry distinguished foreigners from some
distant and facetious country.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned before, that a
friend calling upon me the morning after my
meeting with the Baronne, saw the flower
which she had placed in my hand standing in
a glass of water on the table. An idea struck
me: "Do you know anything of the language
of flowers?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Something," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What, then, is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Secrecy.</span>"</p>




<p class="center">From the Antheneum</p>

<h2>THE THREE ERAS OF OTTOMAN
HISTORY<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h2>


<p>So much has been said and written of late
respecting the decline and decrepitude
of the Ottoman Empire, that most persons
believe that there is nothing to prevent a
Russian army from marching up to the gates
of Constantinople, and taking possession of
the city, except the resistance which might
be offered by the other powers of Europe to
such an extension of the Russian dominions.
Many of our readers will therefore be surprised
to learn that the army of the Sultan is at
present in a more efficient state than it has
been for the last two centuries; and that in
the event of a war breaking out between
Russia and Turkey, the latter would probably
be able to resist, single-handed, the attacks
of her formidable and ambitions neighbor.
This is the view which Mr. Skene endeavors
to establish in the pamphlet before
us; and from information which we have
ourselves received from other quarters, we
entirely agree with the conclusion to which
Mr. Skene has come,&mdash;that "the power of
conquest, possessed by the only state with
which there appears the slightest possibility
of a rupture taking place, is in general as notoriously
exaggerated as that of defence on
the part of Turkey is commonly undervalued."
To enable the reader to obtain an accurate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>idea of the present condition of the Ottoman
army, Mr. Skene gives a brief but able review
of its history. He divides his narrative
into three eras: the first contains an account
of the military history of Turkey till the destruction
of the Janissaries in 1825; the second
comprises the period of transition, which
followed the destruction of the Janissaries;
and the third comprehends the formation of
the Nizam, or the regular army of the present
day. The annals of the first of these
eras are, in fact, the history of the Turkish
conquests, and of the decline of the empire.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> <i>The Three Eras of Ottoman History; a Political
Essay on the late Reforms of Turkey, considered principally
as affecting her Position in the event of a War
taking place.</i> By <span class="smcap">J. H. Skene</span>, Esq. Chapman &amp; Hall.</p></div>

<p>"Through the Janissaries Turkey rose&mdash;by
them she was about to fall; and without the
Nizam, or regular army of Sultan Abdul Medjid,
which exists as a consequence of the destruction
of the Janissaries, she would never
have had any chance of rising again, or even
of saving her political independence."</p>

<p>The Janissaries were organized by Sultan
Orkhan in the fourteenth century. They
bore the title of <i>Yenitsheri</i>, or New Troops,
in contradistinction to the previous armies,
which had been raised by levies of irregular
troops, as occasion required. They were a
well-disciplined body of troops, and they constituted
the principal force of the empire. It
was to their valor and efficiency that the Turkish
empire owed its existence; and they were
almost uniformly successful in all the great
battles which they fought till their defeat by
Montecuculi at St. Gothard, in 1664. This
defeat was the forerunner of a long series of
disasters.</p>

<p>"Their career of conquest was over, and it
was a career altogether without a parallel in
history. Generation after generation had advanced
without ever retrograding a single
step. A vast empire had arisen out of the
hereditary valor and systematic discipline of
a portion of the army. It was not the creation
of the military genius of an individual
like that of Alexander the Great or Napoleon
Buonaparte, but it was the result of a successful
organization, assisted by the inherent bravery
of the Turkish race, which enabled their
sultans to follow up from father to son the
ambitious scheme of the founder of the dynasty.
But, at the close of that era of conquest,
the organization of the Janissaries had
become corrupt, the prestige of almost invariable
good fortune had disappeared, and their
internal discipline was declining fast, while
their indomitable valor had degenerated into
overweening pride, seditious turbulence towards
the government, and cruel tyranny
over the population."</p>

<p>Towards the end of last century the insubordination
and tyranny of the Janissaries had
reached their highest point. The dispersion
of this formidable body had become absolutely
necessary for the salvation of the Ottoman
empire; and it was at length effected by Sultan
Mahmoud II..</p>

<p>"The value of the Janissaries as a regular
army had been sufficiently tested, and the
time had now arrived when Sultan Mahmoud
II. judged it expedient to cut the Gordian
knot. He issued a proclamation, obliging all
his troops to submit anew to the discipline
which they had cast off for more than a century
and a half. The Janissaries refused
obedience. The Sultan unfolded the Sacred
Standard of the Empire, and placing himself,
with his only son and heir, beside it, he appealed
to the patriotism of those around him.
He drew his dagger, and said, in a loud voice,</p>

<p>"'Do my subjects wish to save the Empire
from the humiliation of yielding to a band of
seditious miscreants, or do they prefer that I
should put an end to that Empire by here
stabbing my son and myself in order to rescue
it from the disgrace of being trampled upon
by traitors?'</p>

<p>"He then ordered that the standard should
be planted on the Atmeidan, or Hippodrome;
crowds of people, from the highest to the
lowest class of society, headed by the <i>Ullema</i>,
or magistrates, and the <i>Softa</i>, or students,
assembled round the standard, and, having
heard what the Sultan had said from those
whom he had addressed, the mob, excited by
enthusiasm, hurried away to carry the alarm
through the town. All who possessed or
could procure arms prepared them, and rushed
to attack the barracks of the Janissaries.
The corps of artillery, having torn off the
badges, which were also worn by those abhorred
regiments, that all appearance of fellowship
with them might at once be destroyed,
commenced the onslaught. Three hours,
with 4000 artillerymen and students, incited
by that resolute will, which had foreseen and
provided for every possible casualty during
eighteen years of apparent submission to the
tyranny of a <i>caste</i>, sufficed to annihilate the
military ascendancy which had once made
the sovereigns of Europe tremble abroad, as
it had the sultans at home. The attack, however,
was directed against only one side of
the square, and the other three, as well as
the neighboring gate of the town, were purposely
left open, with the view that those of
the Janissaries who did not wish to resist the
Sultan's order might escape unharmed; and
quarter was given to all who chose to submit.
Similar orders having been simultaneously
sent to every part of the empire where
Janissaries were stationed, the same conditions
were offered to 150,000 individuals affiliated
to the corps. Of these only 3600 refused
them, and they were the most incorrigible
of the chiefs. Having been made prisoners
they were tried by a regular court of
justice, and it was only necessary to prove
their identity in order to condemn them, as
the Sultan had carefully compiled the proofs
of their respective crimes during many years.
Eighteen hundred of them were executed, of
whom 600 at Constantinople, 1200 being put
to death in the provinces; and the remainder
were exiled. Although it must have been
an appalling sight to behold those 600 corpses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
lying on the Atmeidan, one cannot help admiring
the patriotism elicited on that occasion;
when the Janissaries perceived it, they
were stupified by the unexpected excitement
of the people; and many fled, fully convinced
of the impossibility of resisting those over
whom they had hitherto domineered with
impunity."</p>

<p>The Sultan now set himself to replace the
Janissaries by other regular troops; but Russian
ambition did not give him time to organize
a new army, and he was obliged to fight
with his young and undisciplined recruits
against the "veteran warrior-slaves of the
Czar." The Ottoman army was accordingly
defeated; and the war was brought to a close
by the disastrous treaty of Adrianople. His
successor, the present sultan, Abdul Medjid,
has been more fortunate. He has enjoyed
several years of peace, which have enabled
him to form a powerful and well-disciplined
army, of which Mr. Skene gives us a valuable
and interesting account. It was established
at the beginning of the year 1842:</p>

<p>"It is divided into six separate armies, called
<i>Ordu</i> in Turkish. Each of these consists
of two services, the Active, or <i>Nizamia</i>, and
the Reserve, or <i>R&eacute;diff</i>. The former contains
two corps, under the command of their respective
lieutenant-generals (<i>F&eacute;rik</i>); and the
latter, also two corps, commanded in time of
peace by a brigadier (<i>Liva</i>); the whole <i>Ordu</i>
being under the orders of a field-marshal (<i>Mushir</i>).
The general staff of each army is composed
of a commander-in-chief, two lieutenant-generals,
three brigadiers of infantry,
one of whom commands the reserve, two brigadiers
of cavalry, and one brigadier of artillery.
In each corps there are three regiments
of infantry, two of cavalry, and one of
artillery, with thirty-three guns. The total
strength of these twelve regiments of the active
force is 30,000 men, but it is diminished
in time of peace by furlough to an effective
strength of about 25,000 men in three of
the six armies, and of 15,000 in the other
three, in consequence of the recruiting system
being as yet incomplete in its application
all over the Turkish Empire. The whole establishment
of this branch amounts, therefore,
to 180,000 men, belonging to the active
service, but its effective strength is at present
123,000. The reserve of four of the six armies
consists in eleven regiments&mdash;six of infantry,
four of cavalry, and one of artillery;
composing a force of 212,000 effective soldiers,
while the other two armies have not
yet their reserve of soldiers who have served
five years. In time of war, however, the reserve
would form two corps of 25,000 men
in each army; giving a total of 300,000 when
this establishment shall have been completed.
The two services, therefore, as they now
stand, form an effective force of 335,000 men;
and when their full strength shall have been
filled up it will amount to 480,000. Besides
these six armies there are four detached
corps; one in the Island of Crete, consisting
of three regiments of infantry and one of cavalry,
in all 11,000 men; another in the pashalik
of Tripoli in Africa, composed of one
regiment of infantry and one of cavalry, about
5,000 strong; a third at Tunis of the same
strength; and a fourth, which is the central
artillery corps, formed of a brigade of sappers
and miners with engineer officers, the veteran
artillery brigade, and the permanent artillery
garrisons of the fortresses on the Hellespont,
the Bosphorus, the Danube, in Serbia, on the
Adriatic, the coast of Asia Minor, in the
islands of the Archipelago, and on the southern
shores of the Black Sea; in all 9,000
men. These four corps raise the effective
strength of the standing army to 365,000
men. Besides this addition, another augmentation
of 32,000 men will be realized by the
submission of Bosnia and Northern Albania
to the new system; and a further increase of
40,000 men, whom Serbia has engaged to furnish,
may be calculated, as well as 18,000
men serving in Egypt, who are destined to
reinforce the reserve of the fifth army. The
marines, sailors, and workmen, enrolled in
brigades, amount to 34,000 men; and the police
force, picketed all over the Empire, is
nearly 30,000 strong. The grand total of
armed men at the disposal of Turkey, in the
event of her existing resources being called
into play, may, therefore, be quoted at no less
than 664,000 men, without having recourse
to occasional levies, which are more easily
and efficiently realized in Turkey than in any
other country."</p>

<p>The service is popular; the troops are well
paid, and their material comforts are well
provided for:</p>

<p>"The rations consist of meat, bread, rice,
and vegetables in abundance every day, besides
butter or oil to cook them with....
The military hospitals might serve as a pattern
of cleanliness to the first armies of the
world, and the medical officers are now perfectly
efficient, some of them having studied
at European universities, others having become
proficients in their art at the medical
college of Constantinople, and a few being
foreigners. The health of the troops is consequently
excellent; so much so, that on one
occasion when 50 men out of 3450 were in
hospital, it appeared so alarming to the staff
of the garrison that a general consultation
was held to decide on what steps should be
taken to oppose the progress of the sickness.
One man in every seventy is no unusual occurrence
in the hospitals of the British army;
and as for the Russians, they thought
little of 12,000 who died at Bucharest in
1829, 10,000 at Varna, and 6000 at Adrianople.
The Turkish clothing is excellent; it is
strong and warm."</p>

<p>Respecting their probable efficiency in the
field, Mr. Skene remarks:</p>

<p>"In their evolutions the Turkish soldiers
are rapid, especially the cavalry and artillery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>
whose horses are excellent; but there may
perhaps be some room for improvement in
their steadiness. It has been remarked of
late at Bucharest, where the Turkish and
Russian armies of occupations have their head-quarters,
and are consequently often reviewed,
that the latter were infinitely slower than the
former, and that their light infantry drill was
far inferior to that of the Turks, but when
moving in line or open column, the Russians,
stiff as planks and dreading the lash, kept
their distances and dressing somewhat better
than the Turks. It may be added in illustration
of the respective solicitude of the two
armies for the health of the men, that, after
one of these field days, three hundred Russians
went to the hospital in consequence of exposure
to the sun, and one hundred and sixty
of them died, while there has not been a single
instance of the kind amongst the Turkish
troops.</p>

<p>"With such an army as this, formed by a
nation whose inherent bravery has never been
impugned even by its most prejudiced detractors,
it will readily be allowed that, were the
campaign of 1829 against the Russians to be
fought over again now, the result would be
very different, considering how many years
the regular troops of the Sultan have been in
training, and also how undeniably the Russian
army has been falling off, for it was not
then to be compared with what it had been in
1815, and it is not now equal to what it was
in 1829."</p>

<p>The reserve of the army is organized in the
following manner:</p>

<p>"The reserve of the Turkish army is organized
in a peculiar manner. It is composed of
soldiers who have already served five years
in the active force, and who are allowed to
remain in their native provinces on furlough,
and without pay, for seven years more, during
which they assemble for one month of
each year at the local head-quarters of their
regiment, for the purpose of being drilled;
and they then receive their pay, as well as
when they are called into active service in
time of war. This measure, which was dictated
by a spirit of economy, has been eminently
successful, inasmuch as a considerable
additional force is thus placed at the Sultan's
command, without its being a continual burden
to the State; and the efficiency of that
force has been fully demonstrated of late,
when an army of 62,000 men was assembled
by Turkey in the space of six weeks, on the
occasion of the interruption of her amicable
relations with Russia and Austria on account
of the Hungarian refugees. In another month,
200,000 men of the <i>R&eacute;diff</i> might have been
collected at Constantinople had they been required;
and it furnished matter for astonishment
to the many foreigners in that capital
to behold a thoroughly drilled and disciplined
army thus extemporized in a camp, to which
a number of mere peasants in appearance had
been seen flocking from their villages.</p>

<p>"This system is rendered still more complete
by the practice of recruiting regiments
from the same districts, in order that, when
their five years of active service shall have
elapsed, the soldiers may remain together:
and the confusion occasioned by embodying
pensioners in other countries is avoided in
Turkey, where the officers, non-commissioned
officers, staff, and rank and file of a regiment
continue united, whether on active service
or as forming a part of the reserve. They
are engaged in agricultural pursuits, or in
trade, during their seven years of furlough,
being periodically mustered for military exercise,
and always ready to move in a body
on any point where reinforcements may be
necessary, while a salutary feeling of <i>esprit
de corps</i> is maintained by making such regiment
a separate and distinct body of men,
raised in the same locality, and most of its
members being personally known to each
other."</p>

<p>Mr. Skene does not give us any information
respecting the skill and ability of the superior
officers. On this point we must confess we
are not without apprehensions; for however
excellent and efficient the troops of the line
may be, their valor and discipline will be
thrown away, if the higher officers&mdash;which
we suspect to be the case&mdash;are inferior to
those in the Russian service.</p>

<p>The threats of Austria give all this subject
importance. Honest Christendom for the first
time cries, God for the Turk!</p>

United Service Magazine.</p>

<h2>THE CAPTAIN AND THE NEGRO.</h2>


<p>A rather ludicrous circumstance, which
occurred while we lay at Newport, helped
to enliven the usual monotony of a ship's
deck while in harbor. A comical sort of a
fellow, of the name of Morris, belonging to
one of the companies on board, who used to
sing Nigger songs, and who, being a very good
mimic, could act the Nigger admirably, resolved
to turn his talents to account by assuming
the character while in harbor, and
passing himself off among his comrades, except
a few who were in his confidence, as a
black cook belonging to the ship&mdash;his twofold
motive for thus "working the dodge," as he
styled it, being partly the fun he expected
from the mystification of the men and officers,
and partly that he might be allowed to bring
whisky into the ship, there being no hindrance
to the ship's crew bringing goods on
board, as our sentries could not interfere with
them. Borrowing, therefore, an old pair of
canvas trousers, a Guernsey shirt, and tarpaulin
hat from a sailor, and thoroughly engraining
his face and hands with the sooty
composition requisite to give him the true
Ethiopian complexion, he became quite invulnerable
to detection by his coat of darkness.
In this disguise, he rolled about the
deck during the whole forenoon in a partial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
state of intoxication, and came and went between
the vessel and shore, carrying baskets
and parcels of suspicious import with the most
perfect impunity. Towards evening, he began
to sing snatches of Nigger songs, varying
the exhibition with a "flare-up" jawing match
with some of the soldiers, in the sort of gibberish
and broken English so peculiar to the
woolly-headed sons of Ham. This comedy afforded
considerable amusement, especially to
those of his comrades in the secret of his disguise.
As he was dexterous in the tongue
fence of those encounters of rude wit, and
knowing the chinks in the armor of his opponents,
he was sometimes able, by a seemingly
careless though cunning thrust, to administer
a sickener to their vanity, which was the more
galling as seeming to come from a dirty and
half-drunken Nigger. "Ah, soger," he would
say to some poor fellow whom he saw casting
a longing eye towards the busy thoroughfares
of the city; "captain not let you go ashore,
eh? Too bad, eh? much sooner be black
ship's cook than soger." "What's that you
say, you Nigger?" would most probably be
the reply of the soldier, not being in the best
temper, and rather indignant at the idea of
being an object of commiseration to a Nigger.
"Who you call Nigger, eh? Nigger
yourself, sar, more Nigger, a good sight, than
ship's cook, sar; ship's cook go shore when
he please, and get drunk like gentleman, sar;
you a white soger Nigger, me black ship's
cook Nigger&mdash;dat all de difference." Then,
as if in soliloquy, in a deprecatory tone, "Eh!
by Jorze, boff poor Niggers; soger mos' as
'specable as colored Nigger when he keep heself
sober and behave 'screetly, like color gemman."
Stung and irritated by the mock sympathy
of the Nigger, the soldier would now
be for taking a summary revenge out of his
ignoble carcase, when some of the darkey's
friends would interpose, declaring that he was
a good fellow, and they would not see him
ill-used. In the mean time, Morris was supposed
by the orderly-sergeant of his company
to be absent in town, and as such reported to
the captain. Thus far, all had gone on swimmingly;
but there was a bit of a rather unpleasant
surprise preparing for him as the <i>denouement</i>
to this farce, which he had acted
with so much success, which had probably
not entered into his conception of the character,
but mightily increased the dramatic effect
of the representation as a whole.</p>

<p>The captain of his company, who was a bit
of a humorist, either having detected the
masquerader himself, or having been informed
by some busy person of the strange metamorphosis
which one of his men had undergone,
it occurred to him that he had an opportunity
of giving him a taste of Nigger discipline,
that might make him feel more vividly the
character he had been representing with so
much applause. Sauntering, accordingly,
along the deck, with his hands behind him,
until he arrived opposite the circle where
Morris was exhibiting his antics, he deliberately
stepped forward and seized him by the
collar, and, pulling out a raw cowhide from
behind his back, he began to vigorously belabor
poor darkey's shoulders. "O Lor, massa!
O Golly! What you trike poor debil
for? What hell dis?" shouted Morris, who
had no idea that he was discovered, and was
willing to submit to a moderate degree of
chastisement rather than drop his disguise at
that particular juncture. "You infernal grinning
scoundrel," cries the captain, still vigorously
applying the cowhide, "I have been
watching you quarrelling with and aggravating
my men all this afternoon; what do you
mean, you black rascal, eh? Curse your ugly
black countenance, I'll beat you to a jelly, you
scoundrel." As he still continued his discipline
with the cowhide, showing no symptoms
of speedily leaving off, Morris, who was
smarting with pain, at last began to think
more of preserving his skin than his incognito,
and called out lustily, "Captain! I say&mdash;stop!
I am no Nigger&mdash;I am a soldier!" At
this there was a general burst of laughter
from the soldiers, who crowded round, and
seemed to enjoy the scene amazingly; those
who did not know that Morris was actually a
soldier laughing still more obstreperously at
the seeming absurdity of the Nigger's assertion.
The captain, though evidently tickled,
seemed in no hurry to let him go. "Do you
hear the impudence of the black rascal? he
says he is a soldier!" said the captain, addressing
the men who were standing round.
"There, does he look like a soldier!" he continued,
as he turned him round for inspection.
"Go along, you black rascal, and don't let me
catch you among my men again, or I will certainly
serve you out with a few more of the
same sort." So saying, and administering a
few parting salutations of the cowhide as he
released him, the captain walked off, chuckling
to himself at the joke, which I saw him
relating afterwards to some of his brother officers,
to their infinite mirth, if one might
judge from the peals of laughter which his
story elicited. In the mean time, Morris was
fain to get rid of his Nigger character as
quickly as possible: and having, with the aid
of warm water and soap, effected this, he
made his appearance on deck, and reported
himself as having been asleep in the hold
when the roll was called. This the sergeant
reported to the captain, who, satisfied, it is
probable, with the punishment he had administered
with the cowhide, affected to believe
his statement, and sent him word by the sergeant
to take better care in future.</p>

<h2>THE VEILED PICTURE.
A TRAVELLER'S STORY.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The dawn of a fine October morning, in
1817, was just breaking when the Paris
diligence of Messrs. Lafitte and Co. took the
opportunity of breaking also. That of the
former, however, was as glorious as that of
the latter was disastrous. I had been rambling
during the summer months through
that most interesting country; the volcanic
district of Auvergne had laved both my inward
and my outward man in most of the
celebrated waters which abound in that
neighborhood, and was on my return to
Paris, where I expected to find the friends
with whom I had travelled from England,
and hoped to travel back again. It was then
with a light heart that I had, on the preceding
evening, jumped into the <i>coup&eacute;e</i> of the
luckless vehicle at the little town of Gann&acirc;t,
congratulating myself, firstly, on my good
luck in finding a vacant place at all, and secondly,
on that place being in the <i>coup&eacute;e</i>, and
lastly, and most especially, on there being
only one other passenger therein, whereby,
as all travellers by diligence are aware, I was
spared the uncomfortable task of performing
bodkin all the way to Paris, and could take
mine ease in mine own corner. When all
prudential arrangements for the night, such
as air cushion disposed at back, and cloak
drawn over knees, were duly made, I began
to take a survey of my fellow-traveller, who
had greeted me on my entrance with much
civility, but the light did not enable me to do
more than perceive that he was a venerable-looking
old gentleman, whose white locks
escaped from under his travelling cap, and
descended on his shoulders in great profusion.
His manners, however, were so courteous
and dignified, that I, at once, recognized in
him a specimen of that now well-nigh obsolete
race the <i>ancienne noblesse</i>. After sundry
inquiries and observations on the country
through which we were travelling, and divers
speculations as to the period at which our
journey might possibly end, my fellow-traveller
turned to the topic of the battle of
Waterloo, then a recent event. "Now,"
thought I, "for a quarrel." But no; though
he felt for the tarnished glory of the French
arms, he felt yet more for the old family, and
bore me no ill-will for being one of that nation
by whose efforts they had been restored,
and the Corsican usurper expelled. From
these he reverted to the "good old days" of
Louis XV., to whose body of Gardes du Corps
he had formerly, it seemed, had the honor of
belonging, he related many anecdotes of that
period, and was especially prosy about the
ceremonies observed at the court of that dissolute
and <i>bien-aim&eacute;</i> monarch. It was during
a long story of this sort that I fell into a
sound sleep, from which I was awakened by
a loud crash, a pretty considerable thump on
the head, and a heavy weight pressing on
my chest, for all which phenomena, though
startling at first, I was quickly able satisfactorily
to account. The crash was caused by
the ponderous diligence coming into sudden
and violent collision with the ground; the
thump by the same sort of rude contact between
my head and the roof thereof; whilst
the weight which I felt so oppressive was the
body of my fellow-traveller, lying upon me
in a state of complete insensibility, and bleeding
profusely. Freeing myself as gently as I
could from the apparently lifeless mass, I
managed to get the window down, and creep
through the somewhat-narrow aperture, when
the cause and full extent of the accident was
intelligible enough. The iron arm of the
axle of the near hind wheel had broken off
short, and such was the weight of luggage
and packages of all kinds and descriptions
stowed away on the roof, that, going, as I
understand we were, at, for a French diligence
in those days, a rapid pace, the shock
had been sufficient to completely capsize us.
Sudden and severe, however, as the shock
had been, the lives and limbs of the passengers
had escaped without loss or material
damage; those in the interior being too
closely packed for any very violent collision
with each other, and the three individuals in
the cabriolet, of whom the <i>conducteur</i> was
one, being pitched clean, I do not mean any
reference to their persons, but to their mode
of projection, into a ploughed field by the
roadside, where they lay sprawling, and <i>sacr&eacute;ing</i>
and <i>mondieuing</i>, in the most piteous
and guttural tones imaginable, though none
appeared to have sufficient excuse for the unearthly
noises he made from any actual hurt
he had sustained. I was, however, too anxious
to afford help to my companion in the
<i>coup&eacute;e</i>, to ascertain very minutely their condition,
even had I been able to obtain an answer
to my inquiries, where all insisted on
talking at once and at the top of their voices,
and in a tone and with a vehemence which,
in any other country, would have seemed a
prelude to nothing short of a battle royal.
Seeing, however, a peasant, <i>en blouse</i>, standing
hard by, leaning on his spade, and looking
quietly on, I concluded he was not one of
the passengers, and might consequently be of
some use. Accordingly I hailed him, and
after some irresolute gestures, he came up to
me, when I explained, rather by dragging
him to the door of the carriage than by any
verbal communications, which would probably
have failed, for what purpose I wanted
his assistance. Having opened the door of
the carriage, I looked in. There lay my unfortunate
companion, "his silver skin laced
with his golden blood," still insensible and
somewhat cramped, it is true, but not in so
uncomfortable a position as might, under the
circumstances, have been expected, seeing
that I had propped him up as well as I could,
before I made my own exit, with my air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span>
cushion, and that of the seat he had occupied.
Being a tall and heavy man, to get him
righted and out was a work of no small difficulty;
however, our united efforts were at
last successful, and the poor sufferer was laid
on the turf by the roadside, on a couch
formed of cushions, great-coats, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>My assistant, who, I must say, now exhibited
all the alacrity I could wish, and more
handiness than I had expected from him, ran
for water, whilst I proceeded to examine my
unlucky friend's wounds. He exhibited an ugly
gash on the head, from which had flowed
the stream of blood which had so disfigured
his venerable locks. His left shoulder, too,
I found was dislocated. By the plentiful application
of cold water to his head and
temples, and of some hartshorn, which I happened
to have about me, to his nostrils, I at
length succeeded in restoring him to consciousness,
of which the first symptoms he
gave was to glare upon me with an expression
of terror and alarm, and exclaiming, in
accents of deep despair, "Hah! blood!&mdash;more
blood!" He uttered a piercing shriek,
and again relapsed into syncope. Thus assured,
however, that he still lived, the present
moment seemed so favorable for the reduction
of the dislocated limb, that I set to
work forthwith, and, with the assistance of
my friendly <i>paysan</i>, quickly divested him of
his coat, and having placed him in a proper
position, instantly slipped the joint into
the socket, and bound it with my neckcloth.
The snap recalled him to sense, and by the
help of a little brandy from my travelling
flask, he was completely restored. Still he
surveyed me with a terrified look, for which
I could not well account, until I discovered
that my face and dress were stained
with the blood which had flowed from his
wound whilst he lay upon me in the carriage.
I hastened to remove what I conceived to be
the cause of his anxious looks, by assuring
him I had received no injury whatever except
a slight contusion not worth mentioning,
and that the blood, which I washed off in his
presence, was his own. The next consideration
was&mdash;what was to be done? To stay
where we were was out of the question; no
sort of public conveyance would pass that way
<i>en route</i> to Paris until the second morning at
the same hour. My companion's wound required
dressing, and I wanted my breakfast,
for the sharp air of the morning had so quickened
my appetite, that the thoughts of my
disaster were fast fading away before the vision
of <i>caf&eacute; au lait</i> and a <i>biftek</i>. The realization
of this pleasing prospect became the
more probable when I learnt that we were
not more than a short league from the town
of Moulins, whither I instantly dispatched my
trusty <i>paysan</i>, whose faculties and movements
were much quickened by the promise of a
five-franc piece when he returned with some
sort of vehicle to convey us into the town.
During his absence, which lasted two mortal
hours, I had abundant time to consider
and contemplate the person and demeanor
of the individuals whom chance had thus
thrown in my way, and, as it were, upon my
charity. The former still exhibited sufficient
traces of manly beauty to show that, in his
youth, he had been strikingly handsome,
whilst the latter spoke the accomplished and
high-bred gentleman in the truest and least
hackneyed acceptation of the word. Being
now perfectly himself again, he listened with
much interest to such account of our accident
as I was able to give, and, ascertaining
from his bandaged head and shoulder the nature
and extent of my services to him, his gratitude
was expressed in the warmest terms.</p>

<p>"I am the last of an ancient house," said
he, "and but for you should have died on the
road like a dog. I am the Marquis de Marigny,
pray tell me to whom I am under so
much obligation."</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said I, "my name is D&mdash;&mdash;,
by profession a physician, and, at a pinch, a
tolerable surgeon, and I never so congratulated
myself on my slender knowledge of this
branch of the healing art as on the present
occasion."</p>

<p>Further conversation was interrupted by
the arrival of the <i>paysan</i> with a sort of rickety
cabriolet, drawn by so small a horse, decorated
with so large a collar, and covered
with such a profusion of trappings, that, until
he drew up beside us, and I could clearly
distinguish the animal's four legs, I was not
quite sure that the vehicle did not progress by
some locomotive power of its own.</p>

<p>Having roused the <i>conducteur</i>, whom we
found fast asleep amidst a pile of disorganized
packages, we selected our respective baggage,
and, having secured it as well as we could on
and about the cabriolet, I took an affectionate
leave of the good <i>paysan</i>, and, mounting by
the side of my venerable companion, handled
the ribbons and started. Our diminutive steed
however required no great skill in coachmanship,
nor any persuasion to get home again as
quickly as the weight behind him would permit,
so that we soon arrived at the town where,
our arrival being expected, we found mine
host of the H&ocirc;tel d'Allier and his <i>domestiques</i>
on the alert; and, by the time I had made a
hasty toilette, a good breakfast, to which I
did ample justice, was on the table. Our
meal being ended, and my companion complaining
of a good deal of pain, I set forth
in search of an apothecary's shop, where I
procured the necessary materials; and his
hurts having been properly dressed and bandaged,
I advised him to go to bed and seek
the repose he so much needed till dinner time.
In the mean time I amused myself by writing
some letters and in strolling through and
about the environs of this neat and lively
town, which the pen of Sterne has rendered
classic ground. The evening was spent in
my friend's bedroom, as he was not well
enough to join the party in the <i>salon</i>. Nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span>
he was in good spirits, and very
communicative; informed me that he was
the younger son of a noble family in Dauphiny,
but that by the death of his elder
brother, many years since, he had succeeded
to the title and family estate, to which he
had been paying a farewell visit when I joined
him at Gann&acirc;t. These family histories and
sundry interesting anecdotes of the days of
Louis XV. and XVI. so animated the old
man, that I, fearing the excitement in his
present condition, thought it prudent to plead
fatigue and retire to rest.</p>

<p>Before we parted, however, for the night,
he made me promise that I would not desert
him on the morrow if he should not be able
to travel, but that I would accompany him
to Paris, and take up my quarters with him
during my stay in that capital. The next
morning I found him, though much better,
yet still unfit for a continuous journey of any
length. With the assistance, therefore, of our
host, we engaged a <i>voiturier</i> who, for a certain
sum, agreed to take us to Paris by such
easy stages as we might direct and find agreeable.
To describe the road from Moulins to
Paris would be to write a guide-book; suffice
it to say, that the weather was delightful, and
my companion, who not only bore the journey
well, but seemed to derive both health
and spirits from this easy mode of travelling,
was altogether the must amusing companion
I had ever happened to meet with; insomuch,
that I almost regretted, when we pulled up
at the Barri&egrave;re d'Italie on entering the gay
capital of France, that our journey was at an
end. We arrived about four o'clock P. M.,
and drove straight to the Place Beauveau,
where, without his order to the driver to stop,
I should not have failed to pitch upon his residence,
so perfectly was it in keeping with the
appearance and character of its venerable
owner. There prevailed throughout the same
air of antiquity; we were admitted by an ancient
porter and received by another elderly
domestic, well-nigh as venerable and aristocratic
in his appearance as the master, who
expressed in affectionate, yet respectful terms,
the lively satisfaction he felt on again beholding
his <i>cher marquis</i>, whose arrival he had
been expecting for some days, and manifested
the most touching anxiety when he saw the
traces, and heard a brief account of the accident
which had befallen him. My friend, having
most courteously and cordially welcomed
me to his house, consigned me to the care of
Antoine, as this ancient serving man was called,
and by whom I was conducted to a suite
of apartments, <i>au seconde</i> it is true, but most
comfortably and tastefully furnished in the
Louis-Quatorze style of decoration. The walls
were hung with tapestry, relieved at intervals
by splendid mirrors and tables of rare marbles,
whilst a bed, with green silk hangings,
worthy of, and apparently coeval with, Anne
of Austria herself, promised me a night of
luxurious repose.</p>

<p>Having, with Antoine's assistance, unpacked
and arranged my wardrobe, I proceeded
to dress for dinner, and my operations were
scarcely concluded ere he knocked at my door
and announced that it was served. I immediately
followed him down stairs to a spacious
and well-lighted <i>salon</i>, where my friend awaited
me. The repast to which we sat down
gave me a very exalted opinion of the <i>savoir
faire</i> of my friend's <i>chef</i>. There was no <i>rosbif</i>,
no <i>plomboudin</i>, no clumsy attempt at imitation
of the English <i>cuisine</i>, out of compliment
to me; all was French, and all was perfect&mdash;the
soup pure and restoring&mdash;the <i>c&ocirc;tellettes
magnifiques</i>, and the <i>vol au vent superbe</i>.
The Champagne was <i>frapp&eacute;</i> to the minute,
the Chambertin shed its <i>bouquet</i>, and the Bordeaux
of rare quality. Mine host ate and
drank sparingly, but he did the honors of his
table in a manner so courteous, yet so jovial
withal, that our dinner was a protracted one,
and it was late ere we retired to coffee in his
library, an oblong room of noble dimensions,
and so furnished that it would have been called
comfortable even in England, and elegant
every where. The sides were covered with
bookcases, whose shelves contained the best
German, French, and Italian authors, and a
much larger assortment of English works than
is usually found in a foreigner's collection.
The ends were hung with some choice specimens
of the old masters, and one or two of
the modern French school, whilst here and
there on marble tables, or pedestals, stood
some exquisite pieces of sculpture, which
showed to the greatest advantage under the
soft light of three lamps of the purest alabaster,
which hung suspended from the ceiling;
in short, the aspect of the whole apartment
proclaimed the owner to be a man of
wealth, taste and literature.</p>

<p>Amongst the pictures, I observed that a
large one, which hung alone over the mantlepiece,
was covered by a black crape veil or
curtain. This, of course, excited my curiosity;
but as my friend, in describing the others,
never in any way alluded to it, I felt that inquiry
was impossible. In fact, he always
contrived, or appeared to contrive, to divert
my attention when he perceived me looking
in that direction.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," said he, "that I do in some
measure cultivate English literature. I have
read the works of most of your best writers,
and flatter myself that I can almost taste and
appreciate the beauties of your great poet
Shakspeare. I have seen, too, your Siddons
give vitality and form to the sublime conceptions
of his genius. Her <i>Queen Katharine</i> was
noble, her <i>Constance</i> touching, and her <i>Lady
Macbeth</i> terrible. I shall <i>never</i>," continued
he, in a low tone, and as if talking to himself,
"<i>never</i> forget it; it recalled too <i>vividly</i>,"
and here, methought, his eye glanced at the
veiled picture, when, suddenly starting up,
he fetched from one of the shelves the volume
containing that play, and read aloud some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>
passages with a power and effect that quite
surprised me. I was about to compliment
him on the correctness of his conception and
the force of his elocution, but he waived his
hand, as if pained by the images produced on
his mind by the scene he had just read, hastily
restored the book to its shelf, and turned
the conversation to some topic of the day,
which, with other trivial matter, occupied us
till I proposed to retire. Shaking my hand
warmly, my friend jocularly expressed his
hope that, "as I had less on my conscience
than Lady Macbeth, so I should rest better,"
and we parted for the night.</p>

<p>Sleep, however, I could not, though my
body was weary and my couch soft. My mind
had been strongly and strangely excited, as
well by my host's impassioned recital of Macbeth,
as by the crape-clad picture, and I could
not help fancying that there was some mysterious
connection between it and the play.
Thus I lay watching the flickering light emitted
by the embers of my wood-fire, which was
now fast dying away on the hearth, until the
pendule on the chimney-piece announced in
silver tones that it was <i>three</i> o'clock.</p>

<p>"I can endure this no longer," exclaimed I,
"see that picture I must and will. Every
soul in the house is now buried in sleep; why
should I not steal down to the library and
gratify my indomitable curiosity? If it be a
breach of hospitality, it is surely a venial one?
What can the old gentleman expect, if he will
thus tantalize his guests?"</p>

<p>Whilst I thus reasoned with myself, I was
busily employed in wrapping my <i>robe de
chambre</i> about my person and in lighting my
candle, and in one minute, I stood before the
object of my waking dreams, and in another
the light was raised to its proper level and
the crape thrown back; when, instead of
some scene of blood, which my heated imagination
had conjured up, there stood revealed
before my wondering eyes the portrait of one
of the loveliest women I ever beheld. The
head, set gracefully on exquisitely turned
shoulders, exhibited a countenance in which
sweetness and intelligence were intimately
blended. The features, though not what is
termed regular, were most harmonious, and
gave me a clearer idea of Lord Byron's "the
mind, the music breathing from her face,"
than I had ever had before. Her dark chestnut
hair, parted Madonnawise on her pale
and thoughtful brow, fell in rich clusters down
an ivory neck, and finally rested on a bosom
"firm as a maiden's, as a matron's full." But
it was the eyes that chiefly riveted my gaze.
Deep and clear as one of Ruysdael's lakes,
they seemed to reflect in their limpid mirror
every surrounding object. At the first glance
their expression was that of softness; but on
fixing mine upon them as I did, in all the intensity
of admiration, they seemed gradually
to assume so stern an aspect, as if reproving
my impertinent curiosity, that I fairly quailed
beneath their glance. Whilst I thus stood,
rooted as it were to the spot, and lost in mingled
feelings of admiration and wonder, not
unmixed with a certain sensation of awe, a
hand laid gently on my shoulder caused me
to start round, and I beheld my friend standing
beside me. I was about to mutter some
apology, but he stopped me, saying, "It was
my fault, I do not blame you. I ought to
have known that that veiled picture would
excite your curiosity, and I ought not to have
brought you here unless I was prepared to
gratify it. But return to bed, and to-morrow
you shall know my history and that of the
picture now before you. I never yet imparted
it to mortal ear, but as it will interest,
and may possibly be useful to you in afterlife,
you shall have it, as some return for the
services you have rendered me. Good night."
So saying he waived his hand in a friendly
but somewhat authoritative manner, and I
betook myself to my apartment, a good deal
abashed and ashamed of my adventure.</p>

<p>It was late the next morning when Antoine,
presenting himself at my bedside, broke
my slumbers, and with them the current of a
dream of which the picture and the occurrences
of the past night formed the basis. He
informed me he had just dressed his master,
and tendered me the like service, which, however,
I declined, and proceeded, unaided and
alone, to dress with all expedition. My friend
received me in the <i>salon</i>, where we had dined
the preceding day, with his usual benignant
smile; but it was easy to perceive that his
night had not been passed in sleep. He looked
languid and out of spirits, and our breakfast
was a somewhat silent one. When it was
over, he sat awhile lost in deep thought, but
at length, as if by sudden effort, he arose and
took me by the arm, saying, "Allons, M.D.,
let us adjourn to the library, where I will unburden
my mind, and perform the promise
of last night."</p>

<p>The picture was still uncovered, and we
were no sooner seated than, as if fearing his
resolution might give way, he immediately
began thus:</p>

<p>In the year 1770 I had, as I have already
informed you, the honor of belonging to that
distinguished body the Gardes du Corps, and
though my duty required my almost constant
presence at Versailles, I, nevertheless, had a
lodging in this house, which is now mine. I
had at that time but little prospect of ever
possessing a house of my own, and could not
always pay my rent for the room I then occupied
therein. My family, of which I was
the youngest, was rich, but I was poor, and
have often gone without a dinner, because I
had not wherewithal to pay for one. I fell
into debt, which my brother promised, some
day or other, to pay; or I might, perhaps,
get a rich wife, for we men of fashion, whilst
youth and good looks lasted, thought ourselves
fairly entitled to use the folly of wealthy old
dowagers as an instrument placed in our hands
by Providence to enable us to revenge ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span>
on Fortune for her cruelty in making us
younger sons. "Remember," my father used
to say to me, "that there is nothing on which
our good or ill-fate in life so much depends as
on women; we are in their hands; they manage
us as they please; and it is the gentlest
and the meekest who rule us the most effectually."
I, however, led a gay and thoughtless
life, and never troubled myself to inquire
what influence, good or evil, women might
have on my future life. I had three occupations
which took up all my time&mdash;the ordinary
routine of duty at Versailles; to pay assiduous
court to the Prince de Beauveau, who
honored me with his patronage, and for which
reason I chose my lodgings as near as I could
to his hotel; and last, though not least, there
was Mademoiselle Zephirine, <i>premi&egrave;re dansuese</i>
at the Theatre Audinet. You smile, Mr.
D., but recollect that I am now speaking of
more than forty years ago. Ah! it was then
no slight affair to keep a mistress, I assure
you; for, though not allowed to hear one's
name, she was to be openly acknowledged
and as openly fought for when there was occasion.
I had, for instance, to call out an officer
in the Swiss Guards, for presuming to say
that Zephirine had failed in one of her favorite
and most admired <i>pas</i>. The Princess de
Beauveau knew of the connection, and did
not disapprove; so I practiced all the fashionable
dances of the day, that I might qualify
myself to appear as the partner of Zephirine
at the public balls in Paris and at the
<i>f&ecirc;tes champ&ecirc;tres</i> at Versailles, where we danced
on the verdant carpet of the mossy turf.
Zephirine had all the accomplishments and
tastes that take the fancy of a sprig of fashion
of that period; she fenced and rode beautifully;
loved champagne suppers, and doted
on all the costly fineries of Madame Bertia's
splendid show-room. In short, I ruined myself
with so little thought and so much pleasure
that I believed myself to be in love, and
was quite sure that Mademoiselle was as
warmly attached to me; when, one evening,
she came into my room here,&mdash;this very room,
my dear Mr. D., where we are now sitting,
still attired in her theatrical costume, and
with the stage paint not yet rubbed off her
pretty face.</p>

<p>"Chevalier," said she, "take care of yourself,
your creditors are about to pounce upon
you&mdash;yes, to arrest you. I learnt the fact not
five minutes ago from an attorney's clerk, who
makes love to my maid, and I came in to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How can I sufficiently thank you, dearest,"
said I; "and so for me you brave even
a prison, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, not exactly," replied she. "You
see, Chevalier, you have no longer either
cash or credit, and I should be a burden to
you."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, at first I had thoughts of sharing
your fallen fortunes, but a Monsieur Edmond,
the son of an East India Director, has advised
me to abandon my intention and accompany
him to England; 'twill be a saving
to you, and we are going to start immediately;
our travelling-carriage waits. Goodby,
my dear chevalier,&mdash;<i>au revoir</i>!"</p>

<p>With that she made a <i>pirouette</i>, and in
three bounds was out of the room. I ran, I
flew, but Zephirine was too nimble for me,
and I reached the street just in time to see
her jump lightly into the carriage of the rich
Englishman, and drive off at a gallop. To
follow them&mdash;to overtake the ravisher and
force him to resign his prey, was my first impulse;
but, alas! I had no money, nor the
means of borrowing any, and stood, moreover,
in need of the kind intervention of the
Prince de Beauveau between me and my importunate
creditors. There was nothing for
it, therefore, but to digest the affront as well
as I could. When my mind became somewhat
calmer, and I had pretty well got over
the jeers of my acquaintance, I began to ask
myself if I had really loved Zephirine, and
if there had not been more vanity than passion
in all the follies she had led me to commit?
The response was, that I had <i>not</i> been
in love with her, nor she with me. We both
loved a jolly, rackety life&mdash;that was all; she
was too flighty for affection, and I too dissipated
for serious attachment. Besides, a
man rarely allows his whole mind and
thoughts to be entirely engrossed by any woman;
he courts distraction in the variety of
other occupations and tastes; all pursuits, all
channels of employment, are open to him;
and if he be a soldier, he is exposed to so
many vicissitudes and dangers, and meets with
so many adventures, that all the passions are
brought into play, and each in its turn so
blunts and weakens the influence of the other
that none makes any durable impression.
He abandons without scruple, a beloved mistress
for a wealthy wife, and speaks of it
openly without shame or reserve, whilst a
woman would blush at the bare idea of such
an act. Woman's love lives on self-denial,
grows by sacrifices, and expands under the
pressure of misfortune. I do not say that
such is the love of all women, but it is of
that chosen few with whose feelings it is dangerous
to trifle, and who are not to be cast
off with impunity. I have dwelt the more
at length on my connection with Zephirine,
because her name will re-appear in the course
of the history of my first <i>real</i> love. I was,
however (continued M. de Marigny), more
cut up by my misfortune than I cared to confess,
and had thoughts of quitting my lodgings
in the Place Beauveau, and of having
no other residence than the barracks of the
Gardes du Corps at Versailles, when one
evening, at about eleven o'clock, as I was returning
home, pondering upon the urgent
importunities of my creditors, and my brother's
slackness in carrying into effect his promises
and good intention towards me, I heard
piercing shrieks proceeding from the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span>
place whither I was going, and from the spot
where it is crossed by a narrow street which
leads into the Champs Elys&eacute;es, then, neither
paved, nor, as now, ornamented by good
houses on each side. I need hardly add that
this street was as dark as pitch, whilst even
the place itself was only dimly lighted by the
flickering gleam of the one poor lamp which
hung before the hotel of M. le Prince de
Beauveau. I drew my sword, and ran towards
the spot whence the cries proceeded,
but had scarcely gone twenty yards before I
stumbled over a lifeless body. I stretched
out my hands, and caught by the arm a fainting
female, who at the same moment, seemed
to come to herself only to redouble her
cries and lamentations.</p>

<p>"Help! help!" cried she, in a voice choked
by tears.</p>

<p>"Here is help, madame," said I; "what is
the matter&mdash;tell me?"</p>

<p>"Help! they have slain this unhappy gentleman
by my side."</p>

<p>My lodging being close by I ran and shook
the great gate by repeated knocking, until I
roused the porter and my own servant, cried
murder, and, as at that hour of the night
many of the inmates were not yet gone to bed,
a light was soon procured, and all hastened to
the scene of the murder. There we found,
stretched in a pool of blood, a young and
handsome female, her face whiter than the
kerchief which encircled her blood-stained
neck, her ears torn, her hands wounded, and
close beside her the dead body of a man,
somewhat older than herself, and which the
neighbors speedily recognized as that of M.
de Fosseux, a gentleman of some distinction
at the bar, and who lived in the Place Beauveau,
right opposite to my house. A general
cry of horror burst from us all. The victim
had been stabbed to the heart by a
strong and steady hand, and the dagger&mdash;the
instrument with which the crime had been
perpetrated&mdash;had dropt from the wound, and
was bathed in blood.</p>

<p>"There were two of them," cried the
young lady, sobbing; "one seized my hands,
tore the ear-rings from my ears, and snatched
my necklace from my neck, whilst the other
stabbed M. de Fosseux, who fell without a
groan. Ah! if they had but been content only
to rob us!"</p>

<p>Then were the lamentations of the unhappy
lady renewed, and she fell into repeated
swoons, from which she was recalled
only to weep more and more bitterly. We
raised her up and carried her to her own
house, or rather to that of M. de Fosseux,
whither we also carried him, and sent for a
surgeon; but his help was useless; M. de
Fosseux had long ceased to breathe. On receiving
information of the occurrence, a lieutenant
of police came instantly, and very speedily
and satisfactorily decided on a very evident
fact, namely, that the sole object of the assassins
had been plunder, for M. de Fosseux
had been robbed of his watch, his purse, a
valuable ring, the mark of which was still
visible on one of his fingers, and a pair of
diamond buckles. Having satisfied himself
on this point, the officer next proceeded to the
apartment of the young lady, whom he interrogated
most strictly as to all the details
and circumstances attending the commission
of the deed. She replied to all his questions
with much self-possession, and the most exact
precision&mdash;"stated her name to be Eugenie
d'Ermay, by birth a gentlewoman, and a
native of Poitou; twenty-five years of age,
and an orphan, without any private fortune;
and," added she, casting her eyes on the
ground, "I have lived for seven years with
M. de Fosseux, without the sanction of the
marriage tie." He, her sole protector, and
the only friend to whom she could look on
leaving the convent where she had been educated,
had also been her seducer; but he introduced
her to society and to the families of
his friends, and that very evening they had
been supping with Madame la Comtesse de
T&mdash;&mdash;, and were returning on foot, when,
close to their own door, the above tragical
event took place. As to the deed itself, all
had been effected with the utmost rapidity.
Two men whom they had for some time observed
to be following them, suddenly rushed
upon them&mdash;one of the two had seized her
and held her fast, whilst he stripped her of
her trinkets; the other laid hold of M. de
Fosseux, had struck him a too sure and fatal
blow, and robbed him with a dispatch and
address which showed an experienced hand;
all this had been but the work of an instant,
and the two assassins had fled towards the
Champs Elys&eacute;es with such speed that they
were already far beyond pursuit before the unhappy
lady suspected that he whom she loved
was at all hurt, much less that he was killed.</p>

<p>"Did you observe," asked the police officer,
"if one of the men was tall and strongly
made and had red hair, and the other short
and high-shouldered?"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle d'Ermay could not answer
these questions; she felt certain, however,
that the man, who had killed M. de Fosseux
was tall, and her impression was confirmed
by the fact of the blow having evidently been
struck from above downwards. There were
at that time in Paris two highwaymen, one
of whom was called Pierre le Mauvais, and
the other Guillaume le Bossu. These worthies
were the theme of market-places and
wine-shops, and as every robbery and murder
committed in the capital was attributed
to them, this was of course laid at their door.</p>

<p>Whilst listening attentively to this examination,
and marking the profound grief of
Eugenie&mdash;her deathlike paleness and her silent
despair&mdash;I could not but pity M. de Fosseux,
whom cruel fate had thus severed at
the early age of thirty-two, not only from
life, but from so young and lovely a companion.
As Mademoiselle d'Ermay had mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>
the name of the Comtesse de T&mdash;&mdash;,
the officer of police called upon this lady in
order to ascertain the truth of the statement
as to her supper party, and found it to be perfectly
correct. The comtesse, as soon as she
heard of the sad event, hastened to assure
Mademoiselle d'Ermay of her sympathy by
every demonstration of kindness and affection,
and, determined not to leave her in a
house now become one of mourning, with the
corpse of M. de Fosseux for her sole companion,
insisted on taking her instantly to her
own. Mademoiselle d'Ermay consented on
one condition, namely, that she should be permitted
once more to look on him who had
been the only object she had loved on earth.
I was present at this last scene of this sad
drama. Mademoiselle d'Ermay said nothing,
but throwing herself on her knees by the side
of the bed on which they had laid M. de Fosseux,
her hands convulsively clasped together
and her head sunk on her breast, she was absorbed
for some minutes in fervent prayer,
when, suddenly rising and turning to Madame
de T&mdash;&mdash;, she said, "I am ready, madame."
She then immediately quitted the
house in that silence which is the surest sign
of profound affliction, and having seen her
safely conveyed to Madame de T&mdash;&mdash; 's, I took
my leave.</p>

<p>On reaching my own abode, I fell into a
reverie in which I could not help contrasting
the attachment of such a woman as Mademoiselle
d'Ermay with the light and heartless
nature of my connection with Zephirine. Yet
all my feelings revolted at the odious comparison.
What? could I for a moment, even
in thought, place a young lady of good family,
well educated, and whom the arts of a seducer,
under the guise of a friend, had betrayed
into her first and only error&mdash;could I for an
instant allow myself to place her in the same
class with an opera-dancer? I hated myself
for the very thought, which could never have
suggested itself but to one who had never
known any other sort of tie than such as had
bound me to Zephirine&mdash;who had never been
loved, nor ever felt the genuine passion. I
slept not that night, nor did I wish to sleep;
my mind was too fully occupied in recalling
every movement, every gesture, every word
that fell from the lips of Mademoiselle d'Ermay;
her gentle countenance, her angelic
look, and that brow so fair and so open,
whose polished surface even terror the most
appalling had not been able to ruffle. Still I
was not in love with her; I merely tried to
recall her features, which the darkness of the
night and the uncertain glimmer of candles
had not enabled me to see and examine so
perfectly as I could have wished. However,
I promised myself better success the next
day, when I resolved to observe her with the
closest attention, although I felt that in so
doing I was rashly exposing myself to that
undefinable and seducing something which
hung around her like a charm.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It was, perhaps, the consciousness of the
wish formed overnight that determined me
to see Mademoiselle d'Ermay. Neither had
I any desire to resist its power, but rather to
feel it and succumb, for I was well assured,
that if such a one could be won, she was
worth winning. I shuddered when I reflected
how few hours had elapsed since she had
been exposed to the dagger of an assassin,
and could not conceive how it had happened
that till that time I had never seen Mademoiselle
d'Ermay, though she was living close
by me.</p>

<p>In the mean time the family of M. de Fosseux
caused seals to be placed on all the property
of the deceased, and with some difficulty
allowed the unfortunate lady to take
away her clothes and some few trinkets, and
a small sum of money, which beyond dispute
was her own, it being found in a desk on
which her name was engraved, and of which
she had the key. That the family of M. de
Fosseux should look upon her with no friendly
eye was, perhaps, natural enough. However,
in a few days, the heir-at-law of the
deceased waited upon her, and said,</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, M. de Fosseux having been
cut off thus suddenly, has left no will; had
he been able to foresee his death, there can
be no doubt that he would not have forgotten
to make due provision for you; it therefore
devolves on me, as a duty, to supply that
defect, and to fulfil his intentions."</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Mademoiselle d'Ermay,
"I never asked anything from M. de Fosseux,
nor ever expected anything; our connection
was free from all pecuniary considerations,
present or future; excuse me from accepting
any thing."</p>

<p>In this refusal Mademoiselle d'Ermay was
immovable. But to return to myself. The
next day I ventured to call on Mademoiselle
d'Ermay, was admitted, and became thoroughly
aware how necessary was this second
interview, and better light to a due conception
of her beauty. I have said beauty, but
she was, in fact, what might be called lovely
rather than beautiful, sweetness being the
leading characteristic of her countenance,
across which, calm and innocent as it was,
an expression of archness would occasionally
flit and vanish again into one of softness and
repose. An acute physiognomist, perhaps,
might have been led to suspect, from the
form of the mouth and the compression of
the lips, that the repose of Mademoiselle
d'Ermay's features was the result of a strong
will and a haughty spirit rather than a natural
quality. Be that as it may, to eyes untutored
in that science this slight symptom
was not visible, and had no existence; whilst
the simplicity and modesty of her demeanor,
and the perfect propriety of all her actions,
won every heart. Her grief was sincere, and
her tears unaffected, yet she did not wear
mourning for M. de Fosseux; and whilst none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span>
doubted that she deeply regretted him, all
applauded the good taste which restrained
her from rendering her situation yet more
remarked by assuming the outward trappings
of woe.</p>

<p>Some few days after the events of which I
have just been speaking, Mademoiselle d'Ermay
hired a small room on the sixth floor in
this very house. When I heard (continued
M. de Marigny) that the woman who for the
last ten days had never been absent from my
thoughts was living under the same roof with
myself, I experienced a sensation of pleasure,
which was only alloyed by the necessity I
was under of setting out that very night for
Versailles, whither my duty called me, and
would detain me for some time. I was even
on the point of resigning my commission;
and but for the Prince de Beauveau, I really
believe I should have added this to the already
pretty long list of my follies. Mere
chance, however, enabled me to make my
stay at Versailles serviceable to my passion,
for, I must confess it, I loved Mademoiselle
d'Ermay. I happened one day to meet, in
one of the ante-rooms of the palace, the
Comtesse de T&mdash;&mdash;, who having an intimate
friend amongst the queen's ladies of honor,
often came to Versailles. I seized the opportunity
to ask her a multitude of questions
about Mademoiselle d'Ermay, and ascertained
the following facts:</p>

<p>Mademoiselle d'Ermay, though originally
of Poitou, was born at Noyou; her father, a
man of rank, having spent his fortune at
court, emigrated to America, leaving a young
wife and his daughter Eugenie, then only six
years old, with very slender means of support.
Death, ere long, bereft the daughter
of her mother's care, when an old aunt
brought her desolate condition under the notice
of the Archbishop of Paris, by whose recommendation
and influence she was placed
in a convent in this capital, and received the
usual education of a nun, which, though it
failed to stifle generous feelings in her bosom,
it taught her to conceal them. Trained to
keep the secrets of others she became impenetrable
as to her own, and hid a proud and
resolved spirit under the meekest possible exterior.
Mistress of herself, her calmness and
presence of mind never for an instant forsook
her.</p>

<p>"You have seen," continued Madame de
T&mdash;&mdash;, "how far Mademoiselle d'Ermay carries
disinterestedness, and may thence infer
how faithful and devoted a friend she is capable
of being; but," added she, "I have a notion
she <i>could</i> be a most implacable foe.</p>

<p>"The superior of the convent where she
was educated was a relation of M. de Fosseux,
who often visited her, and thus had opportunities
of seeing her youthful charge, and
of ascertaining how much she was neglected
and even ill-treated. Touched with compassion
for her forlorn condition, and smitten by
her beauty, he found means of communicating
with her, avowed his sentiments, and
won her heart. Nothing was easier than to
elope from the convent, as M. de Fosseux
proposed; but the young lady at once rejected
so romantic a mode of proceeding, and
went to the superior and simply demanded
her liberty. It might have been expected
that she would be asked what she was about
to do, and whether she was going; but as
the old aunt had ceased to pay for her board,
and Eugenie was therefore a burden on the
establishment, they allowed her to depart
unquestioned. She immediately repaired to
the house of M. de Fosseux, and their connection
was one of unmixed happiness until
the late fatal accident dissolved it. I have
now told you all I know."</p>

<p>"Then, madame," said I, "your friend is,
in fact, penniless?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say," answered the comtesse;
"it is a point on which Eugenie is obstinately
silent; she has refused to stay with me,
and I think she has had too much experience
of convent life ever to go there again; but I
believe she has some secret but honorable
resource which affords her a decent maintenance.
I have already told you that her
father went to America, where he died, and
his daughter probably got whatever he left
behind him."</p>

<p>As soon as I was off duty at Versailles I
hastened back to Paris; and the first thing I
did on reaching my old lodging was to mount
to the sixth floor, and present myself to Mademoiselle
d'Ermay. I found her occupying
three small rooms, one of which served her
for kitchen, and the one in which she received
me was simply, and would have appeared
poorly, furnished, but for the exquisite
cleanliness and neatness, which gave it an
air of elegance. After due inquiries concerning
her health, I proceeded to congratulate
myself on my good fortune in having the
happiness to be under the same roof; begged
she would command my services in any way
in which they could be useful, and then hastened
to change the subject, for I saw refusal
trembling on her lips.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said I, "to see you in such
apartments as these."</p>

<p>"They are quite consistent, sir," said she,
"with my slender means and the state of my
mind."</p>

<p>I cast my eyes towards the window; she
understood me, and, bursting into tears, withdrew
into the adjoining room to hide her
emotion. In fact, from this window not only
the Place de Beauveau and the house of M.
de Fosseux, but even the windows of his
apartments, were visible. In a few minutes
she reappeared, perfectly calm, with a serene
and even smiling countenance. Never have
I known a woman who had so much command
over herself, or whose composure lent
her such a charm. To see her and resist her
sway was beyond the powers of mortal man,
and I quitted her presence deeply in love, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span>
resolved to leave no means untried to gain
her affections. At the same time I was quite
aware that I could not hope for success under
a considerable length of time, even if she
had not really loved M. de Fosseux. To make
a woman forget a faithless lover is an easy
task; to render her fickle, under ordinary
circumstances, is an enterprise in which many
succeed; but to efface the recollection of
so bloody a catastrophe, whilst pressing my
suit in perhaps the self-same well-remembered
words and expressions of its lamented victim,
seemed so all but hopeless an undertaking, that
it required the stimulus of the most ardent
passion not to shrink from it in despair. I
had, however, some chances in my favor; I
was young, though some years older than
Mademoiselle d'Ermay; and as time has now
shorn me of personal attractions, I may perhaps
be allowed to boast that I was considered
a good-looking fellow; finally, in the eyes of
such a woman as I then loved, I had one special
recommendation&mdash;I was poor. Now Mademoiselle
d'Ermay, though caring little for the
conventional rules of society, was scrupulous
to the last degree in all that related to sentiment,
generosity and disinterestedness, insomuch
that the only circumstance which annoyed
her in her connexion with M. de Fosseux
was, that he was rich. All she required was
the like absolute devotion as that which she
herself rendered. It was to such a woman
as this that, three months after the death of,
M. de Fosseux, I hazarded a declaration of
my passion. That I really felt what I so
warmly and so earnestly avowed, it required
not a woman's sagacity to perceive. I had
given up all my favorite amusements&mdash;no
more riding and driving, no more evenings at
the theatre, no more supper parties. I had
become pale and thin, and felt assured that
Mademoiselle d'Ermay was at no loss to what
cause to attribute such a change in my person
and pursuits; neither did she affect to
doubt the reality of a passion of which the
proofs were so evident, nor did she attempt
to deny that the human heart was not made
for eternal sorrow, or that time could not
heal its deepest wounds, but she pleaded the
very peculiar position in which her lot had
placed her.</p>

<p>"Chevalier," said she, "do not, I pray you,
press me to return your passion. Love can
no more find entrance into my bosom, and
you know its dire consequences if it could:
it is fatal&mdash;it is mortal."</p>

<p>"Banish," said I, in return, "such sad
recollections. Why regard yourself as the
cause of an unhappy event to which you
yourself had so nearly fallen a victim? I can
understand your repugnance hereafter to
wear, or to see worn by your friends, diamonds,
or such valuables as tempt the plunderer,
but to renounce love at your age, and
with your beauty, that were indeed too much,
especially when you have inspired such a
passion as mine; and oh! consider the difficulties,
the trials, the dangers inseparable from
your present position, and tell me if, instead
of rejecting, you ought not, on the contrary,
to seek some one to whom you may look for
assistance, and on whom you may rely for
support?"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle d'Ermay acknowledged all
this to be true; nevertheless she hesitated.
At length, however, by dint of love and perseverance,
I succeeded in weakening her objections,
and in satisfying her scruples, and
she consented to receive my addresses. She
even confessed that I was not indifferent to
her; but when with expressions of love I
mingled promises and oaths of eternal fidelity.</p>

<p>"Have a care," said she. "I ask nothing;
I require nothing; but promises are, in my
eyes, sacred matters. You are lavish of
oaths&mdash;if I accept them, I shall look on
them as binding. Is there not some ancient
poet who says that "Jove laughs at lovers'
perjuries?" I am more severe than Jove. I
give you fair warning, M. le Chevalier."</p>

<p>"Where is the lover," added M. de Marigny,
"who, under like circumstances, does
not redouble all the oaths his mistress seems
to doubt? Where is he who would hesitate
to swear that he is the most truthful and constant
of men? Who would not vow <i>eternal</i>
love to <i>such</i> a woman?"</p>

<p>My old friend here raised his hands and
his eyes to the picture before us, and remained
for some moments in an attitude of deep and
silent admiration. At length he slowly
withdrew both, and with a deep sigh resumed
his narration.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle d'Ermay consented, but reluctantly,
and with the ill grace of a woman
who yields in spite of herself; however she
did yield, and quitted her apartments on the
sixth floor for mine on the first. From that
moment, my friend, I knew the bliss of being
loved, and loved too without jealousy or quarrels,
but with a sweet, constant, and equable
flow of affection which I had not hitherto
believed to be possible. No thought of the
past, no anxiety for the future, seemed to have
any place in Eugenie's mind; but happy in
the conviction of my love, she manifested towards
me as much attachment and even passion
as she had exhibited hesitation and reserve
on consenting to my wishes. Never,
by any chance, did she allude to past events,
nor did the name of M. de Fosseux ever escape
her lips. I was proud of my conquest;
prouder of the passion I had inspired&mdash;a passion
which she did not feign, but feel. There
was no pouting, no jealous freaks, none of
those ebullitions of temper which so disturb
the peace and harmony of even the most attached
couples: she was always in the same
mood; her countenance always serene, her
words always sweet and soothing; nay, more,
my circumstances were, as I have told you,
embarrassed; and I was so deeply in debt,
that I owed even the freedom of my person
to the interposition of the Prince de Beauveau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span>
when Mademoiselle d'Ermay undertook
the management of my affairs, called on my
creditors in person, examined their claims,
obtained time for payment, struck out usurious
demands; and, when my brother at length
thought proper to come to my aid, paid the
stipulated sums to each with such business-like
accuracy, that my creditors gave me no
further trouble, and in a very short space of
time I was completely free from all claims
and incumbrances. She held that a gentleman's
word should be his bond, and that no
other security ought to be necessary or required.
When I reflected on the change
which had taken place in the course of my
life, and on the growing ascendancy which
Eugenie exercised over me, and when I saw
my foolish fancies and ill-formed plans give
way, as they continually did, before the influence
of her firm and well-regulated mind, I
blushed to think how poor a figure I made,
and what a mere puppet I was in the hands
of a clever but imperious woman. Far from
seeing love in all the care she bestowed upon
me, I saw only a spirit of domination which
hurt my pride. Even Zephirine, the opera-dancer,
deceiving and abandoning me as she
did at the very moment when I was harassed
by debts contracted for and by her, had less
deeply wounded my self-love than did Mademoiselle
d'Ermay in thus devoting herself to
my interests. Such is man! vain and ungrateful!
Such, however, were her powers
of fascination, that I could not help loving
her, and whilst I thus yielded to her sway, I
had, as you see, this one secret feeling in my
bosom which I could not impart to her. How
soon was I to be guilty of other wrongs towards
her! My elder brother died, and I
became the head of the family. I became
rich, too, and might also lawfully claim the
title of marquis instead of that of chevalier.
Will you believe that I said nothing of all this
to Mademoiselle d'Ermay? I sighed for liberty;
I wanted to enjoy my accession of fortune
without her privity, and to spend my
money unrestrained by her good sense and
unchecked by her prudence. I went secretly
to my agent and gave him instruction as to
my affairs, and all without saying one word
to the woman who, till that moment, had
known my most secret thoughts, and was accustomed
to read my very looks. I thought
of the figure my fortune would enable me to
make at the gaming table, which Mademoiselle
d'Ermay had prevailed on me to give up,
and in all those pleasures which a Garde du
Corps of fortune can enjoy with his comrades.
For these purposes it was necessary that I
should resume my duty, from which I had
been absent on leave for nearly a whole year,
and I announced my intention accordingly.</p>

<p>"You choose your time ill," said Eugenie,
in a quiet tone; "if you resume service you
must be less with me, and it is not prudent
to quit the citadel at the very time it is attacked."</p>

<p>When I asked an explanation of these last
words, this was (continued M. de Marigny),
the substance of what she told me; and, that
you may understand their import, I must tell
you, that before the year 1789, the higher
classes of our clergy were composed of the
younger sons of noble families, who were in
the receipt of large incomes from the Church;
and the bishops and canons of those days, endowed
as they were with fat livings and rich
abbeys, did not think themselves at all called
upon to reside on their several preferments,
but lived in Paris and about the court, where
their course of life was not always strictly
evangelical. One of them, whose name I
shall not mention, as it is not material to
my story, had remarked Mademoiselle d'Ermay.
What had particularly taken his fancy,
as he said in a letter which Eugenie put into
my hands, was her youthful and ingenuous
countenance, her retiring manners, her love
of seclusion, and her modest yet animated
style of conversation. He made her splendid
offers, to which he attached this one condition
only, namely, that their intercourse should be
a profound secret; and, he added, that in
leaving me she would, moreover, silence the
scandalous reports which had so long been
circulated to her disadvantage.</p>

<p>"It was Tartuffe," said M. de Marigny, with
a bitter laugh; "trying to wean Elmire from
the gallants of the court, by offering her love
without scandal, and pleasure without danger."</p>

<p>"You know," said Eugenie, when she
showed me this letter, "that even if I were
free to accept an offer, and this right reverend
gentleman pleased me, I could never stoop to
such a mere bargaining as this; but I love
you, my friend, and you alone, and I show
you this letter only because we have no secrets
from each other."</p>

<p>Thus, at the very moment when she was
sacrificing for my sake an ample and secure
provision, I, on my part, was concealing from
her my new and altered position in life; yet
at the same time I knew she had nothing, for
her father was not dead, as Madame de T.
supposed, and had never sent her a single
<i>sou</i>. I was on the point of confessing all;
but false shame restrained me, and I set off
for Versailles. I was like a man who vainly
endeavors to break his bonds.</p>

<p>When I quitted Eugenie and galloped
through the Champs Elys&eacute;es and up to the
quarters of my troop I breathed freely. I
felt I was at liberty; but twenty-four hours
had hardly elapsed ere I grew weary of this
same liberty and longed to see Eugenie again,
and to resume that yoke of which I was
ashamed I knew not why, for it was easy, and
had become necessary to me. What would
have become of me if Eugenie had accepted
the offers of that libertine priest and left me!
So in the middle of the night I mounted my
horse and went back to Paris. I found her,
as usual, thinking of me, and hoping, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>
expecting, my speedy return. I then took to
play, but its chances failed to excite me. I
suffered myself to be dragged out to those
supper parties which I had once found so
pleasant, but it was only to cast my eyes
round the circle in search of <i>her</i>, and when
they found her not, nor ever rested on a face
so beaming as hers, weariness soon crept over
me, and I found the dishes tasteless, the wine
vapid, and the conversation dull.</p>

<p>In the mean while, I had reached that period
of life at which ambition becomes a ruling
passion, and mine was to be rich. Without
rendering me avaricious, Mademoiselle
d'Ermay had taught me to know the value
of money. I had known poverty and endured
most of its attendant privations, and
I was now in the possession of a large and
unexpected fortune, but I wanted more. Just
at this time I received a letter from my
mother.</p>

<p>M. de Marigny here paused for a moment
and appeared lost in thought; he was like a
man who hesitates to finish the story he has
begun, and who, having disclosed one half of
his secret, has some misgiving as to telling
the other half, when, suddenly seizing my
hand and looking me full in the face.</p>

<p>"Sir!" said he, in a tone of voice so solemn
that it sent the blood back to my
heart, and caused my not very weak nerves
to tremble; "I was considering whether I
ought not to require you to swear that you
will never reveal to any mortal ear what I
am about to relate (the perspiration stood in
large drops on his venerable forehead); but
'tis no matter&mdash;I have begun and I will finish&mdash;my
story may be useful as a lesson and a
warning to others."</p>

<p>He went on.</p>

<p>My mother suggested, that as the period of
mourning for my brother was over (alas!
wishing to conceal that event from Eugenie I
had not worn any), it was time to look into
the affairs of a family of which I was now
become the head. She advised me to resign
my commission in the Gardes du Corps as an
idle sort of life without any chance of promotion,
and, as if she had read my thoughts,
added, that I had nothing to do but to enjoy
my wealth and at the same time increase it,
for which there was a ready mode and present
opportunity. It was this. She had selected
for my brother the best match in the
county&mdash;the marriage was fixed, the settlements
agreed upon, and the contract drawn,
when his death deranged all; why should not
I carry into effect so well-formed and advantageous
a plan? The young lady in question
had known but little of my brother; she had
no attachment to him, and merely married
him because her family wished it. She was,
moreover, young, pretty, and very rich. My
mother urged me to quit Paris without delay,
and come and secure a match which would
double my fortune. Being thirty years of age,
and completely my own master, I did not consider
obedience, especially in such a matter, a
duty I owed to the commands even of a mother;
but I saw in the proposal an opportunity
which might never again offer of breaking
bonds which every day became tighter,
and more and more wounded my pride. Besides,
the <i>money</i>, the <i>money</i> tempted me.
"Why," said I to myself, "should I not be
able to love this pretty girl whom they propose
I should marry? She is, perhaps, even
handsomer than Mademoiselle d'Ermay; and
who knows but she may love as well, and
without subjecting me to that sort of sway I
feel so onerous?" I reflected, too, on the
false position in which I was placed. I lived
with a mistress, of whom I was not the first
lover, but only the second. Nevertheless, I
knew Mademoiselle d'Ermay's character so
well, was so fully assured of her inviolate
fidelity, and still felt so much attached to her,
that I could not make up my mind one way
or the other, and was in a most lamentable
state of indecision. I had without much difficulty
thus far concealed from her the death
of my brother; but if I absented myself and
went into Dauphin&eacute;, though only just to look
at the lady proposed for my wife, she would
guess all, and, on my return, my contemplated
abandonment would be repaid by her taking
leave of me for ever. Some plausible pretext
for leaving her was therefore necessary&mdash;a
mission, or something of the sort, from
government, on business in the north of
France, whilst I hastened to the south, and
tried to find in the love beaming from other
eyes a release from that which had hitherto
chained me to Paris. The absolute necessity
of concealing this new secret made me a totally
different man to what I was wont to be.
I became moody and abstracted; and, whilst
brooding in silence over my own thoughts,
and fondly fancying that I never betrayed
myself by even a gesture or hasty word, Mademoiselle
d'Ermay had divined the whole, and
was tracking with unerring sagacity, and into
the inmost recesses of my soul, all my wavering
resolves. She saw my timid spirit halting
between herself and a rich wife, whilst harboring,
perchance, some vague fancy for
change. For so it is; we are never content
with that which we have, but we want more,
or we want something else, and are always
wanting to be happy in some other way than
that in which we are so. Eugenie, herself
impenetrable, read my heart as if a book;
yet she lavished upon me the same tokens of
affection, and always received me with the
same sweet and calm demeanor. At length,
one day, when I was in my study, debating
with myself how and where I should answer
my mother's letter, Mademoiselle d'Ermay
entered, every feature of her sweet round
face elongated and sharpened and fixed in
frightful rigidity; her soft eyes glared, her
rosy lips were bloodless. I thought she was
suddenly seized by illness, or that some cruel
accident had affected her reason. She appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>
to stagger, and I was rising from my
seat to support her, when her hand, laid on
my shoulder, pressed me back again into my
chair. The skirt of her dress was turned up
as high as her waist, and within its folds her
clenched hands held something which, at each
movement she made, sounded like the small
stones in a child's rattle.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Eugenie?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I. Do not you know me? <i>I</i> am
not changed; <i>I</i> am still the same."</p>

<p>So she said; but it was no longer the same
woman. Her very voice was altered, a Gorgon,
a Meg&aelig;ra stood before me.</p>

<p>"Eugenie! Eugenie!" cried I.</p>

<p>She looked at me steadfastly, and as though
the innermost thoughts of my mind were
written on my forehead; and the first words
she uttered fully apprised me that she knew
one of my secrets.</p>

<p>"M. le Marquis," said she: she knew my
brother was dead. "M. le Marquis," she continued,
in hoarse accents; "listen to me. I
have never mentioned M. de Fosseux to you,
and you do not know his story. I must tell
it you. I was the inmate of a convent, young
and fair, unhappy it is true, but pure of heart
and discreet in conduct. I might, like my
companions, have taken the veil and passed
my life in a cloister, without either pain or
pleasure. M. de Fosseux saw me, and fell in
love with me. You can never know what
pains he took, what arts he practised to seduce
me, for I was then a virtuous girl, and
my reputation, was without spot; and though
I do not reproach myself for what I have
done&mdash;yet I well know that in the world I
have judges more severe than my own conscience."</p>

<p>I made a second attempt to rise; not that
I at all foresaw what was coming, but merely
for the purpose of saying a few words to calm
her, but she promptly shut my mouth by
fiercely commanding me to listen.</p>

<p>"So pressing were his instances, so solemn
his oaths, that they convinced me of the violence
and sincerity of his passion. I listened
and believed, and he prevailed. Yes, M. le
Marquis, I believed his oaths of fidelity. I
loved him; not so well as I love you; still I
loved him. Alas, marquis! I ask you, for
you know well, be it pride or be it self-devotion,
what have I ever required in return for
my love? Nothing but a steadfast observance
of the faith pledged to me, and you have
not now to learn how I have kept that which
I myself plighted. I ask no contract; I demand
no guarantee. I live upon the present
without one thought of the past, or one anxiety
for the future, confiding in the <i>honor</i> of
the man I love with a feeling of security,
which is at once my joy and my pride; faithful,
I never asked but for faith; and, poor as
I am, have I not rejected offers to be rich?
Thus much then have I done for you and for
M. de Fosseux; but M. de Fosseux deceived
me; he ceased to love me, he was in treaty for
a wealthy bride, and, cowardly as perfidious,
heaped upon me the outward signs and tokens
of a love he no longer felt; and why?
Because he wished not to abandon me till the
last moment&mdash;because he wished to deceive
me until he could no longer wear a mask.
This, marquis, was what M. de Fosseux intended
to do, and this was what he would
have done had he lived one week longer. I
knew the name of his betrothed; and I knew
the amount of the dowry to which the cupidity
of my lover was about to sacrifice me.
Now, marquis, what did such perfidy deserve?
What was a woman to do who had asked
nothing, exacted nothing, and to whom so
much had been promised? Her prospects
blasted and her honor lost&mdash;a cherished inmate
of your home, whilst the fancy lasts;
but appetite once satiated, turned out without
one&mdash;&mdash;. This the return for all her
constancy and devotion: disgrace, base desertion,
and, as if injury were not enough, you
add mockery and insult, by smiling in her face
whilst you are preparing to pierce her to the
heart."</p>

<p>Whilst thus speaking (continued M. de
Marigny), the looks of Mademoiselle d'Ermay
assumed a yet more fierce expression, her
voice became hoarser, her gestures more violent,
and, with her increased agitation, whatever
she had folded up in her dress returned
a yet more alarming sound.</p>

<p>As for me, frightened, appalled, my hands
trembling, and my forehead bathed in a cold
sweat, I attempted to mutter something, I
knew not what. No, never did Clairon, nor
Dusmenil, nor your Siddons, whom I had
seen some years before in England, so freeze
my blood in the deepest tragedy. Struck by
the resemblance between my own conduct
and that of M. de Fosseux, I at length exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Eugenie! Eugenie! of whom are you
speaking? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Of whom am I speaking? Of M. de Fosseux
to be sure. What other man could be
capable of a similar crime&mdash;of such base perfidy?
Do you imagine it to be possible that
there can be in the world two men so heartless&mdash;so
utterly devoid of honor?"</p>

<p>"No, Eugenie," exclaimed I again; "No!
I will never abandon you&mdash;<i>never</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And who is talking of <i>you</i>, marquis?"
retorted she sharply; "I am speaking of M.
de Fosseux."</p>

<p>I could not believe my eyes; my ears, too,
nay all my senses seemed in combination to
deceive me. I would have given all I was
worth for some of the servants to enter and
dissolve the spell.</p>

<p>"I am speaking to you of M. de Fosseux,"
repeated she. "Do you remember, marquis,
the day&mdash;or rather the night&mdash;on which we
met for the first time? <i>That</i> man dead at
my feet&mdash;myself stretched in the gory mire
of the Place Beauveau&mdash;the dagger yet in the
dead man's breast&mdash;the blood with which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span>
was covered&mdash;my cries, my tears, my bruised
neck, my torn ears, my story of two robbers,
my swoons, my sobs.... Do you remember
all this, marquis? Well, then, <span class="smcap">'TWAS</span> I&mdash;<span class="smcap">'TWAS</span>
I, I tell you!"</p>

<p>At these last words I uttered a loud cry,
and was about to rush out of the room, but
she held me fast.</p>

<p>"'Twas I, I tell you; <i>alone</i> I struck the
traitor, and here are my proofs."</p>

<p>"Saying this, she opened her hands, and
shook her dress, when brilliant buckles, a
necklace of rubies, diamond rings, and a gold
watch, rolled glittering on the floor, and
seemed to hem me in on all sides with their
sparkling points, whilst in the midst of these
bloody relics lay a letter, which I instantly
recognized as my mother's!</p>

<p>"Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;," said the old man to me&mdash;who
was motionless, and scarcely dared to
draw my breath&mdash;"I have been an old soldier,
and, thank God! was never looked upon
as a coward; many is the time I have boldly
faced danger, and have, too, exposed my life
through mere fool-hardiness; but a man may
have courage, yet not all kinds of courage;
I was frightened, Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;; the blood rushed
to my head, my hair stood on end, my
temples throbbed audibly, and I fell senseless
on the floor."</p>

<p>When I came to myself (continued M. de
Marigny) I found myself in bed; a copious
bleeding had removed all immediate danger,
and I seemed as though awaking out of a
troubled sleep, in which I had been haunted
by some fearful dream. Mademoiselle d'Ermay
was at my side, with her sweet countenance,
her words of love, and her tender and
affectionate looks, and held both my hands in
hers. Tears were stealing down her fair
cheeks, and as soon as I opened my eyes she
threw herself into my arms.</p>

<p>"Oh! chevalier," said she, "what an alarm
you have caused me! Cruel man! to go into
your own room without saying you were
ill, and remain there alone and without help!
Oh, my friend! however troublesome you
may think me, I will never leave you again&mdash;I
will follow you even into your study; but,
my dear chevalier, I hope you will believe
me in future."</p>

<p>Believe you! (exclaimed I) starting up.
She laid me down again, and replaced my
head on the pillow. Ah! said she to herself,
there is still some delirium here; and then,
addressing me.</p>

<p>"Yes, my chevalier, <i>believe</i> me. What
has been my advice to you for these several
days past? Has it not been to lose a little
blood this spring time?&mdash;yet you would not
be prevailed on to follow it. Your physician
himself says that one bleeding would have
saved you your illness, and me my fright. I
do hope, chevalier, you will be more docile
next spring."</p>

<p>I shut my eyes, and essayed to retrace in
thought all the circumstances of the scene under
which I had so recently sunk. Though
my head was confused, and my body weak,
I recalled every thing present and past. My
memory carried me back to the Place Beauveau&mdash;again
I saw the features of M. de Fosseux
pale in death, and Mademoiselle d'Ermay's
look of despair. Moreover, as a principal
witness in the unhappy business, having
been the first person who arrived at the spot
where the murder was committed, I was examined
by the magistrate, and had read over
Mademoiselle d'Ermay's deposition, in which
she had described the several articles of the
stolen jewelry with the greatest accuracy.
I then mentally compared this careful and exact
description, as given in the said deposition,
with the articles which Eugenie had
thrown down before me, and I seemed to see
and recognize them all: a gold enamelled
watch, a necklace of rubies, diamond ear-rings,
rings set in brilliants, and ... my mother's
letter! I had hidden that letter in a
secret drawer in my desk, which the maker
of it had shown me alone how to open, and
he was dead before I knew Eugenie; yet that
letter had fallen at my feet! I saw the black
seal, and thought I read the address in my
mother's handwriting. It was impossible I
could have dreamt all this! Another idea
dwelt painfully on my mind: I have already
told you the murder of M. de Fosseux was
generally attributed to two men of desperate
character, Pierre le Mauvais and Guillaume
le Bossu. The police had diligently followed
this scent, and, after tracing them to various
haunts, at last succeeded in capturing both;
but they proved, most clearly and incontestably,
that they were both at Ronen on the
night of the murder, and all the other researches
of the police had been in vain.
Knowing all these circumstances as I did, they
now recurred to my mind in such force as to
bring on a fresh attack and another fit, which
had obliged them again to call in my surgeon.
What he found it necessary to do I know not;
I only know that the result was long doubtful,
and that nothing could equal the sorrow
and assiduous care of Mademoiselle d'Ermay
so long as that doubt lasted. At length I
came to myself.... She was at the foot of
my bed, and in that sort of half-sleep which
will sometimes overtake even the most wakeful
and indefatigable nurses. I but partly
opened my eyes, and carefully avoided making
the slightest noise or movement. Her
head rested on one of her hands, leaving
somewhat more than the side-face and her
fair cheek, now blanched by anxiety and
watching, and the beautiful hair that hung in
clustering curls over her white forehead, open
to my view. Sleep often betrays our most
secret thoughts, and the stuff of which
dreams are made is sometimes revealed by
involuntary movements. I narrowly watched
her countenance; but no, there was nothing&mdash;she
slept as calmly as a child. "<i>She!
she!</i>" said I to myself&mdash;"<i>she</i> commit a murder!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span>
Could that white and delicate hand
grasp a poniard, and strike the man she
loved a deadly blow, and that too in the middle
of the night, and in the open street? Why,
the most practised villain, the commonest
stabber, is not so sure of his aim as to be certain
that his victim will fall without uttering
one cry, and expire without knowing the
hand that slays him; and that Eugenie should
dare to feel more confidence in herself than
such men do! and that she should never exhibit
any symptoms of remorse! That I,
who was so constantly with her, should never
by any chance have detected any signs of
a guilty conscience! never have found her
low-spirited or absorbed in thought!" ...
But I had seen her in my study&mdash;I had heard
her terrible confession&mdash;the rattling of the
jewelry as it fell from her dress on the floor,
still sounded in my ears! Perhaps, however,
I had dreamt all this&mdash;perhaps this cruel vision,
this horrible phantasmagoria, instead of
being the cause, had been the first symptom
of my disorder? If so, from what source
had my imagination drawn these bloody horrors?
How had my heart and mind been
able to engender such frightful calumnies
against the best of women? True, I was
thinking of emancipating myself from Eugenie's
yoke, and of leaving her, in order
to marry advantageously; but even whilst I
was planning our separation I did justice to
the angelic sweetness of her nature; and so
far was I from supposing her capable of
committing a crime, that I thought with regret
of how many good and noble qualities I
was about to deprive myself the contemplation
and example in leaving her.</p>

<p>Some days before the occurrence I have
just narrated (added M. de Marigny), one of
my servants cut himself in moving a piece of
furniture, and Eugenie, who happened to be
present, nearly fainted at the sight of the
blood; and when I joked her about her weakness,
the wound not being at all serious,
"Chevalier," said she, "do not laugh at me;
you know I cannot bear to see even a chicken
killed." I had, indeed, remarked that,
though in housekeeping affairs she was always
active and vigilant, she never went into
the kitchen. I was in a dreadful state of uncertainty,
for, in spite of all my reasonings
on the subject, there was still the fact&mdash;I <i>had</i>
seen her&mdash;I <i>had</i> heard her; it was <i>herself</i> beyond
all doubt. Twice had her hand, pressing
on my shoulder, pushed me back into my
chair. The more I tried to banish these recollections,
the more they crowded upon me;
and whilst thus tortured by these anxious
speculations, I made a hasty movement as
she awoke.</p>

<p>"You then, of course," said I, interrupting
his narrative for a moment, "demanded an
explanation of her terrible confession?"</p>

<p>"Impossible, my good friend," replied he;
"I was by no means sure of my own sanity,
and Mademoiselle d'Ermay would have
treated such a demand as the ravings of delirium."</p>

<p>"You are very ill, my dearest chevalier,"
said she; "your mind has often wandered
since yesterday, and as the dreams of a sick
man commonly take their color from his waking
thoughts, I have discovered, whilst listening
to the indistinct mutterings which fell
from you in sleep, that there is one sore place
in your heart. You love me, chevalier, truly
and sincerely. I know you do,&mdash;but you are
jealous!"</p>

<p>"Jealous!" cried I, in a feeble voice.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but of the past; you have no doubt
of my feelings towards you now,&mdash;you do me
that justice; but you are afraid that I loved
M. de Fosseux yet better."</p>

<p>"M. de Fosseux! M. de Fosseux! for God's
sake, Eugenie, do not pronounce that name."</p>

<p>"Why? Since yesterday it has been continually
in your mouth, and you have scarcely
ever ceased to utter it and speak of him
with bitterness. Ah! my friend, let the
dead rest in peace: you must have observed
that from the first moment of our connection,
I never mentioned or alluded to M. de Fosseux,&mdash;you
must have made me forget him.
Oh! believe me, my chevalier, I swear&mdash;and
you know how sacred I hold an oath&mdash;I never
loved M. de Fosseux as I love you. Do
not then allow such painful fancies to harass
you; think how happy we are&mdash;as happy as
it is possible to be in this world,&mdash;so happy
that every body envies us."</p>

<p>In saying this, her lovely face lighted up
with a heavenly smile, expressive of love and
contentment; and if a small but almost imperceptible
cloud did rest for an instant on
her calm brow, it was easily accounted for
by her anxiety for me. At length one morning
I awoke, and, not without a certain degree
of satisfaction, perceived that I was
alone. She was not there. I rang the bell,
and a servant came.</p>

<p>"Your mistress?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle; where is she?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle is at church; it is Sunday,"
answered the servant.</p>

<p>She was attending divine service at the
church of St. Roch, as she never failed to do
both on Sundays and saints' days.</p>

<p>I dismissed the servant, rose hastily, threw
on my dressing-gown, and, with unsteady
step, hurried to the desk in which I had locked
up my mother's letter. The desk was untouched.
At the very part of it where the
drawer was so skilfully contrived, and of
which I alone possessed the secret, there
were some grains of dust, clearly proving
that the mysterious spring had not been
touched for a long time. I opened it, and
there lay my mother's letter, exactly as I
had, with my own hands, placed it! Astonished
and confounded, I went to Mademoiselle
d'Ermay's room. Her keys were on her
dressing-table; <i>she</i> had neither suspicions nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span>
secrets! I searched every where, turned
every thing topsy-turvy. Not a hole nor
corner did I omit to rummage; and I shuddered
the while, for I was every moment expecting
to find the watch, the rubies, and the
diamonds which I had seen, or fancied that I
saw, scattered before me on the floor of my
study. But no, there was nothing of the sort.
Was it, then, a dream&mdash;a frightful illusion,
and the mere forerunner of my illness? By
some strange contradiction, or some magnetic
power which a strong will exercises over a
feeble one, I felt that I loved Eugenie a hundred
times better than ever, and crawled
back again to my bed, convinced that I had
been mistaken, and the victim of a fearful
dream. I then considered the case in another
point of view, and asked myself whether,
even supposing Mademoiselle d'Ermay to be
guilty, she had not some excuse for her
crime? What could be more base and dishonorable
than to abandon so fond and devoted
a woman? Had not M. de Fosseux
deserved his fate? And I, who had entertained
the same design, and had been on the
point of committing the very same act of
treachery, and for the very same vile motive
of adding to an already large fortune, what
was <i>I</i>, then? Had she meant to give me an
awful warning of the fate which awaited me
if I proved as faithless as M. de Fosseux? I
was lost in conjectures. There was, perhaps,
one way of extricating myself from this labyrinth,
or, at least, of throwing some light on
the darkness by which I was surrounded. I
might ascertain from the family of M. de Fosseux
if at the time of his death he was engaged
to be married. I, however, rejected
this idea; for, whether it proceeded from
love or from infirmity of purpose, I preferred
darkness to light, and blindness to perfect
vision. "Yes," said I to myself, "I have
dreamt it all; my imagination has mixed up
M. de Fosseux with the wrong I was myself
about to inflict, and, whilst meditating a
crime, I have also imagined its cruel punishment.
Truly, I have had a shocking
dream!"</p>

<p>My reflections had led me thus far, when
Mademoiselle d'Ermay returned from church.
She came and took her accustomed place at
my bedside.</p>

<p>"Eugenie," said I, "I have much to tell
you."</p>

<p>"Do not talk, chevalier; you are still too
weak for conversation."</p>

<p>"No, Eugenie, I am better. My head is
clear, and my delirium past; so listen. In
the first place, my brother is dead."</p>

<p>"Accept my condolences, and allow me to
congratulate you on your accession to wealth
and a higher title."</p>

<p>"My dear friend," said I again, "my mother
has written to me. She requires me to
do two things; one is to go for a time to my
estate in Dauphin&eacute;, and the other to get married.
Surely, then, this is the auspicious moment
to obtain the sanction of the Church to
our union?"</p>

<p>"You are right, marquis," she answered,
quietly, "for the king and queen" (Louis XV.
was dead), "and especially the Princess Elizabeth,
his majesty's sister, are very strait in
their notions, and might otherwise possibly
look coldly upon you when you are presented."</p>

<p>Within a week we were married.</p>

<p>"She became your wife?" exclaimed I.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I am still in mourning for her,
and shall continue to wear it to the end of
my life."</p>

<p>There was no change in our domestic arrangements;
all went on as usual, except
that my friends and acquaintance, and my
people, instead of calling Eugenie Mademoiselle,
addressed her as Madame la Marquise.
In the world my marriage was not blamed;
on the contrary, it was approved. It was an
event which every body seemed to have expected,
and, taking place, as it did as soon as
I became rich, was voted to be alike honorable
to Mademoiselle d'Ermay and myself. I
must tell you a trait which will enable you
to judge how my wife&mdash;for so I must now
call her&mdash;interested herself in the events of
my former life. A few days after our marriage
she said to me,</p>

<p>"My dear marquis, I used formerly to go
sometimes to the theatre of Audinet&mdash;did
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, marquise, often."</p>

<p>"There was at that time a young <i>danseuse</i>
on those boards who attracted my attention:
she was called, I believe, Zephirine; do you
remember her?"</p>

<p>"I had forgotten her, marquise, and but
for your recalling her to my mind I should
never have thought of her again."</p>

<p>"She was a giddy girl, I understand," continued
she, "and from mere love of change
left Paris and France some years ago with a
wealthy Englishman, through whose indulgence
and her own indolence she neglected
her dancing&mdash;a talent soon lost without constant
practice&mdash;and she has grown fat and
lost her agility. The Englishman has become
tired of her and turned her off, and she cannot
get an engagement even in London;
would you now be so kind as to make her
some small allowance?"</p>

<p>I did so, and my wife would never listen
to the confession I begged her to hear. I
then took my wife into Dauphin&eacute;, and presented
her to my mother, who at first received
her very coldly, as I expected&mdash;for
this marriage had marred all her plans&mdash;but
she was soon so won by the unvarying sweetness
of her temper, and the irresistible fascination
of her manners, that she conceived the
warmest affection for her, and no mother-in-law
ever loved a daughter better. My good
fortune excited some jealousy, and the beauty
of my wife much admiration. A gentleman
in the neighborhood fell in love with her,
and was bold enough to declare his passion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span>
she instantly, and without the smallest hesitation,
informed me of the insult she had received,
and I, as promptly, decided on calling
him out; a resolution which Eugenie at
first opposed, but on my insisting that as I
had in former days fought for a mistress I
could not do less for a wife, she said, "Go,
then, and avenge me; if you fall, I will not
survive you."</p>

<p>My antagonist was severely wounded; and
this proof of spirit obtained me the more
credit in my neighborhood, as my cause
was so just. The revolution broke out whilst
we were in Dauphin&eacute;, and I wished to return
without delay to Paris; but my wife dissuaded
me. "You are no longer in the army,"
said she; "you left it when you married me,
and you therefore owe no personal service to
the king; stay here, where you may perhaps
be useful to others, and certainly so to yourself."</p>

<p>I followed counsels which had long since
become the only guide of my will, and it was
well I did so, for we passed in peace and
retirement that period which was so fatal to
our aristocracy; and when the storm was
over, "Now," said she, "let us go to Paris."</p>

<p>Here we lived in the enjoyment of happiness
which nothing ever alloyed, and of a
mutual affection which age neither cooled
nor impaired. Thus, you see, my friend
(continued M. de Marigny), I have been led
through life by my wife; but she strewed the
path with flowers, whilst the circumstance
which, as it were, compelled me to marry her
saved me from the commission of a base and
unworthy act, for which I should never have
ceased to reproach myself, and which would
have rendered my life miserable. Yes, all
has been for the best.</p>

<p>"You mean by that," said I, "that you
have had sufficient strength of mind to control
your imagination and to become thoroughly
convinced that preceding events were
the mere dream of a delirious man?"</p>

<p>Wait awhile (quietly pursued M. de Marigny).
Two years ago, my wife was seized by
sudden and severe illness; she had up to that
moment enjoyed invariable good health, and
though she was upwards of fifty, her smile
retained all its sweetness, and her countenance
was as serene as ever. When she found
herself unable to leave her bed, she gave herself
up for lost.</p>

<p>"I feel that I shall die, my dear friend,"
said she to me one day, "and I have some
few requests to make of you; you will not
marry again&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>At these words I burst into tears, and poured
forth again all my former oaths, and
which, considering our long attachment and
my advanced age, it was no longer difficult
to keep.</p>

<p>"I know," said she, "you will never give
your name to another woman; I feel sure of
that. What I wish is, that you should retire
to your estate in Dauphin&eacute;, and there, in
peace and tranquillity, end your days where
your father and mother died and are buried;
and, that you may have no inducement to
remain in Paris or ever return to it, sell your
house; and then, having no interest in the
capital, you will find it the more easy to perform
what I have now requested, and what I
feel assured you will promise me to do."</p>

<p>I promised all she required; and in so
doing it appeared to me that I was adopting
the wisest and most prudent course. There
was, moreover, in the idea of going to die
amidst the tombs of my ancestors and of
mingling my ashes with theirs, a feeling of
piety which melted me to tears. Eugenie,
once feeling assured that her last wishes
would be obeyed, asked for the attendance
of a priest, and died with the same courage
and composure as had marked her whole life.</p>

<p>"Sir," said her confessor to me, "God is
just and merciful. He pardons the repentant
sinner&mdash;your wife is a saint in heaven."</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe my grief, my
despair, and the state of utter loneliness into
which this sad bereavement plunged me: I
have other matters to talk of. When Eugenie
was no more I had no longer any will but
my own to consult; and though deeply regretting
the absence of that sway I had been
so long accustomed to, I nevertheless followed
inclinations which were no longer controlled.
It was a feeling of piety which had first made
me promise to retire into Dauphin&eacute;, and it
was now a similar feeling which determined
me to remain where I was. Why should I
go and die amidst ancestral tombs? Why
make it a point of duty to mix my ashes
with theirs? I lost my father when I was
a mere child; I scarcely remembered him;
and I had lived very little with my mother,
whereas, my whole life had been spent with
Eugenie. It was therefore near her that I
ought to end my days, and in her grave that
I ought to find my final resting place; nor
could I understand how it was that she had
not expressed a wish to that effect, and I persuaded
myself that if she could now see me
she would approve of the change in my resolution.
When I had once made up my
mind to remain in Paris, it was no longer
requisite or convenient to sell my house; and
to tell you the truth, I was very desirous to
keep it. I had inhabited it from my youth;
I had improved and embellished it, and it recalled
to my remembrance the only woman
that I had ever sincerely loved. My whole
life had been spent in it; in it had been acted
the whole drama of my existence, and there
was not a corner nor a piece of furniture in
it which did not awaken some thought or recollection.
I resolved then to live and die
in Paris. But, my friend, though our dwellings
of brick and mortar are more durable
than those of our own mortal clay, they, nevertheless,
from time to time require repair,
or they would fall into a state of utter dilapidation.
Several months ago, my people told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>
me that some tiling was wanted to the roof,
and that the flooring of the rooms on the
sixth story was sadly out of condition. These
were the rooms of which Mademoiselle
d'Ermay had been the last occupier; in fact,
my wife had always taken to herself these
three rooms which she had occupied in her
poverty, and the keys of them remained in
the hands of my people till after that my
grief had somewhat subsided. I wished to
revisit the scene of my wooing, and the hallowed
spot where Eugenie had responded to
my passion. My first visit was made alone,
and I gave way without restraint to the feelings
which the scene was calculated to excite.
On this occasion, however, I went up with
the workmen. Time, and the dampness of
a room always kept closed, had almost entirely
destroyed the flooring. They set to work
in my presence, and scarcely had they raised
up the mouldy boards and decayed joists,
than I saw diamonds glitter, and rubies, and
gold&mdash;those dreadful jewels which had caused
me so much terror and such a severe illness&mdash;there
they were, the very same....</p>

<p>"Great God!" cried I; "then she <i>had</i> killed
M. de Fosseux!!!"</p>

<p>The old man <span class="smcap">NODDED</span>.</p>

<h2>THE SPENDTHRIFT'S DAUGHTER.
IN SIX CHAPTERS.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER THE FIRST.</h3>

<p>"Frugality is a virtue which will contribute
continually and most essentially
to your comfort. Without it, it is impossible
that you should do well; and we know not
how much, or how soon, it may be needed."</p>

<p>So writes Southey to his son, Cuthbert,
just then starting at Oxford.</p>

<p>The proposition might have been expanded
from the particular to the universal. Southey
might have said, that in no condition of
life, from that of her who sitteth upon the
throne, to that of the handmaiden who grindeth
behind the mill, can frugality&mdash;in other
words, system and self-denial as regards the
expenditure of money&mdash;be dispensed with.
Self-denial and diligent attention in the management
of this great talent are necessary in
all.</p>

<p>No one of the gifts of Providence appears
to the casual observer to be bestowed with
less regard to individual merit than wealth.
It would almost seem, as an old divine has
written, as if God would mark his contempt
of mere material riches by the hands into
which he suffers them to fall. Although, fall
where they will, and on whom they will,
one thing is certain;&mdash;that they will prove
but a delusive snare to those who know not
how to order them;&mdash;when to husband, and
when to spare; when to spend, or when to
bestow.</p>

<p>These reflections arose from a story with
which, not long ago, I became acquainted.
A common tale enough&mdash;one among a thousand
illustrations of what Butler affirms to
be the indispensable condition upon which it
has pleased our Creator that we should hold
our being:&mdash;that of controlling our own actions;
either by prudence to pass our days in
ease and quiet; or, by rashness, ungoverned
passion, wilfulness, or negligence, to make
ourselves miserable.</p>

<p>He is sitting on the bottom stone of a magnificent
flight of steps, which lead up to a
handsome door, situated in the centre of a large
many-windowed house, which, fronted with
handsome iron rails round the area, is built
of fine brick, and ornamented with abundance
of stone-work, in cornices and architraves.
This house stands in one of the best
streets in the neighborhood of Grosvenor
Square.</p>

<p>He is clothed in garments that once were
fashionable; but now are discolored with
much wear and long exposure to wind and
weather; so much so, that, in several places,
they are falling into tatters. His face&mdash;the
features of which are very finely cut, and
still bear the traces of a once very remarkable
beauty&mdash;is wan, attenuated, and begrimed
with dust, dirt, and neglect. His eyes are
haggard; his hair dusty and dishevelled&mdash;his
beard ragged and untrimmed.</p>

<p>He is the picture of physical decay, and of
the lowest depths of moral degradation. He
sits there upon the stone, sometimes watching
the street-sweeper&mdash;a little tattered boy
cheerily whistling over his work&mdash;now and
then casting up his eyes at the closed windows
of the handsome house, upon which the beams
of the rising sun are beginning to shine; but
to shine in vain at present; for it is only
about six o'clock in the morning, and life has
not yet begun to stir within the mansion.</p>

<p>His cheek rests upon his thin, withered,
and unwashed hand, as he casts his eyes first
upwards, then downwards, then slowly, and
with a sort of gloomy indifference, around.</p>

<p>He looks upward. Is it towards the sky;
where the great lord of earthly light&mdash;type
of that more Glorious Sun which should arise
"with healing on its wings"&mdash;is diffusing the
cheering effulgence of the dawn, calling forth
the fresh and wholesome airs of the morning,
and literally chasing away the noisome
spirits of the night? Is he looking there?</p>

<p>No; he is no seeker of the light; he feels
not its blessed influence; he heeds not the
sweet fresh rising of the morning as it breathes
over the polluted city, and pours, for a few
short moments, its fresh, crisp, cheering airs
into the closest and most noisome of her
quarters. He cares not for that delicious
brightness which gives to the vast town a
pure and peculiar clearness for a few half
hours, whilst all the world are asleep, and the
streets are yet guiltless of sin and sea-coal.</p>

<p>What has light; the pure breath of the
morning; the white rays of the early sun;
and the soft, quiet, and refreshing stillness of
the hour, to do with him? He only lifts up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span>
his eyes to examine a house: he only casts
them around to observe what goes on in the
streets; he is of the earth, earthy,&mdash;the sacred
odor exists not for him.</p>

<p>Yet, in the deep melancholy, the expression
of harrowing regret with which he <i>did</i>
look up at that house&mdash;even in the very
depths of his moral degradation and suffering&mdash;the
seeds of better things might be germinating.
Who shall say? He has sounded
the very base-string of misery: he touches
ground at last&mdash;that may be something.</p>

<p>The sparrows chirped in the rays of the
sun, and the little sweeper whistled away.
Different figures began sparingly to appear,
and one by one crept out; objects of strange
aspect who seem to come, one knows not
whence;&mdash;the old clothes-man, with his low
and sullen croak; country carts; milk-men,
rattling their cans against area rails; butcher-boys
swinging their trays. Presently were
heard, immediately below where the man was
sitting, the sounds of awakening life;&mdash;unlocking
of doors, opening of windows, the pert
voices of the women servants, and the surly
responses of the men; shutters above began
to be unfolded, and the eyes of the large
house gradually to open. The man watched
them&mdash;his head resting still upon his hand,
and his face turned upwards&mdash;until, at length,
the hall-door opened, displaying a handsome
vestibule, and a staircase gay with painting
and guilding. A housemaid issued forth to
shake the door-mat.</p>

<p>Then he arose and slowly moved away;
every now and then casting a wistful glance
backwards at the house, until he turned the
corner, and it was lost to his sight.</p>

<p>Thus he left a place which once had been
his own.</p>

<p>With his head bent downwards, he walked
slowly on; not properly pursuing his way&mdash;for
he had no way nor object to pursue&mdash;but
continuing his way, as if he had, like a ball
once set in motion, no motive to stand still.
He looked neither to the right nor to the left;
yet seemed mechanically to direct his footsteps
towards the north. At length, he slowly
entered one of the larger streets in the
neighborhood of Portland Place. His attention
was excited by a bustle at the door of
one of the houses, and he looked up. There
was a funeral at a house which stood in this
street a little detached from the others. The
plumes were white. It was the funeral of an
unmarried person. Why did his heart quiver?
Why did he make a sudden pause? Had he
never seen a funeral with white plumes before
in his life?</p>

<p>Was it by some mysterious sympathy of
nature that this reckless, careless, fallen man&mdash;who
had looked at the effigies of death, and
at death itself, hundreds and hundreds of
times, with negligent unconcern&mdash;shuddered
and turned pale, as if smitten to the heart by
some unanticipated horror?</p>

<p>I cannot tell. All I know is, that, struck
with a sudden invincible terror, impelled by
a strange but dreadful curiosity, he staggered,
rather than walked forward; supporting
himself as he went against the iron rails, and
thus reached the steps of the house just as
the coffin was being carried down.</p>

<p>Among the many many gifts once possessed,
and all misused, was one of the longest,
clearest, and quickest sights that I ever remember
to have heard of. His forlorn eye
glanced upon the coffin; it read:</p>

<p class="left50">"<span class="smcap">Ella Winstanley</span>,<br />
Died June 29, 18..<br />
Aged Twenty-three."</p>

<p>And he staggered. The rails could no longer
support him. He sank down upon the flagstones.</p>

<p>The men engaged about the funeral lifted
the poor ragged creature up. A mere common
beggar, they thought; and they were
about to call a policeman, and bid him take
charge of him; when a lady, who was standing
at the dining-room window of the house,
opened it, and asked what was the matter?</p>

<p>"I don't know, Ma'am," said the undertaker's
man; "but this here gent has fallen
down, as I take it, in a fit, or something of
the sort. Policeman, hadn't you best get a
stretcher, and carry him to the workhouse or
to the hospital?"</p>

<p>"No," said the lady, "better bring him in
here. Mr. Pearson is in the house, and can
bleed him, or do what is necessary."</p>

<p>Upon which the insensible man was carefully
lifted and carried by two or three of the
men up the steps. At the door of the hall
they were met by the lady who had appeared
at the window. She was evidently a gentlewoman
by her dress and manners. She was
arrayed very simply. Her gray hair was
folded smoothly under her bonnet-cap; her
black silk cloak still hung upon her shoulders;
her bonnet rested upon a pole screen in the
dining-room. It seemed by this that she was
not a regular inhabitant of the house in which
she exercised authority. Nothing could be
more gentle and kind than the expression of
her calm, but firm countenance; but upon it
the lines of sorrow, or of years, were deeply
traced. She was, evidently, one who had
not passed through the world without her
own portion of suffering; but she seemed to
have suffered herself, only the more intimately
to commiserate the suffering of others.</p>

<p>They laid the stranger upon the sofa in the
dining-room; and, at the lady's desire, sent
for Mr. Pearson, who was the house apothecary.
Whilst waiting for him, she stood with
her eyes fixed upon the face of the stranger;
and, as she did so, curiosity, wonder, doubt,
conviction, and astonishment were painted
in succession upon her face.</p>

<p>Very soon Mr. Pearson appeared, and advised
the usual remedy of bleeding. The lady
walked to the window, and stood there, watching
the proceedings of those without, until the
arrangements of a very simple funeral were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span>
terminated, and the little procession, which attended
the young Ella Winstanley to her untimely
grave, gradually moved on, and disappeared
at the turning of the street.</p>

<p>The countenance of the lady, as she returned
to the sofa, showed that she had been
very much moved by the sight.</p>

<p>Having been bled, the stranger opened his
eyes; which now, as he lay there, extended
upon the sofa, displayed a gloomy but remarkable
beauty&mdash;a beauty, however, arising rather
from their form and color, than from
their expression, which was more painful than
interesting. Again the lady fixed her eyes
upon his face, and again she shuddered, and
half turned away. Pity, disgust, and regret,
were mingled in her gesture.</p>

<p>The stranger's eyes followed her, with a
dreamy and unsettled look. He seemed to
be as mazed with wonder as she was.</p>

<p>She turned again, as if to satisfy her doubts.
His eyes met hers; and, as they did so, recollection
seemed to be restored.</p>

<p>"Where am I, and what is it?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"You are where you will be taken good
care of until you are able to be removed,"
said the lady. "Is there any one you would
wish to have sent for?"</p>

<p>The man did not speak.</p>

<p>"Any one you would wish to be sent for?"
she repeated.</p>

<p>"No," he answered.</p>

<p>"Any thing more you would wish to have
done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>He lay silent for some time, with his eyes
still fixed upon her.</p>

<p>At last he said, "Tell me where I am?"</p>

<p>"Where you are welcome to be until you
can gather strength enough to proceed to the
place to which you were going when this attack
seized you. And that was&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere. But what house is this?"</p>

<p>"A house only destined for the reception
of ladies," she answered.</p>

<p>"Ladies! what ladies?"</p>

<p>"The sick who have no other home."</p>

<p>"A house of charity, then?"</p>

<p>"Partly."</p>

<p>"And that one&mdash;that one&mdash;that young
creature, whose funeral&mdash;Do you know her?
any thing about <i>her</i>&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the lady, with gravity,
approaching to severity, "I do know <i>much</i>
about her."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why did she come here?"</p>

<p>"Because she was friendless and deserted;
poor, sick, and miserable. She had given up
what little money she had to supply the wants&mdash;perhaps&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;the vices of another.
Happily there were found those who
would befriend her."</p>

<p>"And she accepted the charity; she received
the alms?"</p>

<p>"She had learned to submit herself to the
will of God."</p>

<p>He shut his teeth together with a something
between bitterness and contempt at these last
words, and turned his head away.</p>

<p>"You are her father?" said the lady.</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you are a very wretched man," she
added.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "I am most miserable."</p>

<p>"You are one who have reaped from seeds,
which might have produced a rich harvest of
happiness, nothing but black and blighted
misery."</p>

<p>She spoke with unusual severity, for her
soul recoiled at his aspect: she saw nothing
in it to soften her feelings of indignation.</p>

<p>"I have lived," he answered.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"How! as others of my temper have lived.
It was not my fault that I was born with an
invincible passion for enjoyment. I did not
make myself. If pleasure be but the forerunner
of satiety&mdash;if life be but a cheat&mdash;if
delight be but the precursor of misery&mdash;a delusion
of flattering lies,&mdash;<i>I</i> did not arrange
the system. Why was virtue made so hard,
and self-indulgence so enticing? I did not
contrive the scheme."</p>

<p>"Such excuses," the lady replied, "the
honest consciousness within us rejects; such
as your own inner conscience at the very moment
you utter them disclaims. She who is
gone&mdash;a broken-hearted victim of another's
errors&mdash;hoped better things when she exhausted
almost her last breath in prayers for
you."</p>

<p>"Prayers!" in a tone that spoke volumes.</p>

<p>"Yes, prayers."</p>

<p>"What is become of my other daughter?&mdash;I
want to go to <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>"She died, I believe, about twelve months
ago."</p>

<p>"Then I am alone in the world?"</p>

<p>"You have no children now."</p>

<p>"Are you going to turn me out into the
street?" he suddenly asked, after a short silence.</p>

<p>"The rules of this house&mdash;which is dedicated
to the assistance of sick and helpless
women&mdash;will not admit of your remaining."</p>

<p>"I am going. You will hear of me next as
one past recovery; picked up out of some
kennel by the police. You would have done
better not to have restored me. I should
have died quietly."</p>

<p>"But without repentance."</p>

<p>"Repentance!" he said fiercely. "Repent
while my whole soul is writhing with agony?
Ella! Ella! if I could only have kept my Ella,
she would have tended me&mdash;she would have
soothed me&mdash;she would have worked for me."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the lady, "she would have
done this, and much more&mdash;but God has
taken her; has rescued her from your heartless
selfishness." To herself she added&mdash;for
her heart was glowing with indignation&mdash;"Even
in this supreme moment, he thinks of
nothing but of himself."</p>

<p>"She would have been more gentle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span>
me than you are," he said, with a half-reproachful
sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;she would have felt only for
you&mdash;<i>I</i> happen to feel for her."</p>

<p>"Which I never did."</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You say true," said he, musing.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER THE SECOND.</h3>

<p>"Julian Winstanley&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He who won the steeple-chase yesterday?
Who, in the name of goodness, is Julian Winstanley?
A name of some pretension; yet
nobody seems to know where he came from."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, that is quite a mistake. I beg
your pardon&mdash;<i>everybody</i> knows where he
came from. This bird of gay plumage was
hatched in a dusky hole and corner of the
city; where his grandfather made a fabulous
fortune by gambling in the funds."</p>

<p>"He is as handsome a young fellow as ever
was hatched from a muckworm."</p>

<p>"He is a careless, dashing prodigal, whatever
else; and I never look at him without
thinking of Hogarth's picture of the 'Miser's
Heir.' What say you to him, Blake, with
your considering face? Come, out with your
wisdom! You can make a sermon out of a
stone, you know."</p>

<p>"May be so. A stone might furnish matter
for discourse, as well as other things; but I
am not in the humor for preaching to-day.
I can't help being sorry for the scapegrace."</p>

<p>"So like you, Contradiction! Sorry for
him! And, pray, what for?&mdash;<i>because</i> he is the
handsomest, most aristocratical-looking person
one almost ever met with&mdash;<i>because</i> he is
really clever, and can do whatever he pleases
in no time (might have taken a double-first
at Oxford easily, Penrose says, if he would)&mdash;or
<i>because</i> he has got countless heaps of
gold at his banker's; and nobody to ask him
a why or a wherefore; may do, in all things,
just what he likes&mdash;or <i>because</i> he can drink
like a fish, dance like Vestris, ride like Chiffney;
be up all night and about all day, and
never tire, be never out of spirits, never dull?
Harry Blake! Who'll come and hear Harry
Blake? He is going to give his reasons, why
a man who has every good thing of the world
is most especially to be pitied."</p>

<p>"I am going to do no such thing. The
reasons are too obvious. I deal not in
truisms."</p>

<p>"Well, all I know is, that he won the steeple-chase
yesterday, and to-day he beat Pincent,
the champion, at billiards. To-morrow he
goes to the ball at Bicester; and see if he
does not beat us all at dancing there, and bear
away the belle, whoever the belle may be&mdash;though
the blood of a stockbroker does run
in his veins."</p>

<p>"His blood may be as good as another's, for
aught I know," said the philosopher; "but I
doubt whether the rearing be."</p>

<p>"It is the blood, depend upon it. Blake,
you are quite right," said a pale, affected
young man, who stood by, and was grandson
to an earl; "the blood&mdash;these upstarts are
vulgar, irremediably, do what they will."</p>

<p>"That not quite," said Harry Blake. "I
have seen as great cubs as ever walked
behind a plough-tail who would call cousins
with the Conqueror, Warndale. But a something
there is of difference after all; and, in
my opinion, it lies in the tradition. Wealth
and distinction are like old wine, the better
for keeping. Time adds a value, mellows,
gives a certain body&mdash;an inappreciable something.
Newly-acquired wealth and distinction
is like new wine&mdash;trashy. I rather pity
the man who possesses them, <i>therefore</i>."</p>

<p>"And I do not"&mdash;"And I do not,"&mdash;and "A
fig for your philosophy!" resounded from all
sides of the table.</p>

<p>The philosopher looked on with his quiet
smile, and added:</p>

<p>"I do not mean to say that I should pity
any of those here present in such a case, for
we all know, by experience, that new wine,
in any quantity, has no effect upon them;
never renders their heads unsteady&mdash;was
never known to do so. But you must allow
me to pity Julian Winstanley; for I think his
wits are somewhat straying, and I fear that
he has already mounted upon that high horse
which gallops down the road to ruin."</p>

<p>And so away they all went to the ball at
Bicester that night. Most of them were somewhat
more elaborately dressed than the occasion
required. Julian Winstanley was, undoubtedly.
It had been his mother's injunction,
never to spare expense in any thing that
regarded his toilette; and dutifully he obeyed
it.</p>

<p>I am not going to give you a description of
his dress. Fancy every thing most expensive;
fancy, as far as a natural good taste would
allow, every habiliment chosen with reference
to its costliness; and behold him waltzing
with a very pretty girl, who is, upon her side,
exquisitely dressed also. She wears the fairest
of white tulles, and the richest of white satins,
and has a bouquet of the flowers from the
choicest of French artists in her bosom, and
another negligently thrown across her robe.
Hair of remarkable beauty, arranged in a
way to display its profusion, and the very
expensive ornaments with which it is adorned.</p>

<p>Although the young lady&mdash;who is the
daughter of a very fashionable and extravagant
man, celebrated in the hunting and
racing world&mdash;is well known to be portionless,
yet she is the object of general attraction;&mdash;a
thing to be noted as not what usually
happens to young ladies without sixpences, in
these expensive times. But it is the caprice
of fashion, and fashion is all-powerful. So
Julian, who is only starting in the career of
extravagance, and in its golden age of restless
profusion, and far removed, as yet, from that
iron age which usually succeeds it&mdash;namely,
that of selfish covetousness&mdash;is quite prepared
to cast himself at her feet&mdash;which with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</a></span>
little good management of her and her mother's,
he soon actually did. Having, as yet,
more money in his pocket than he knew
how to get through, he was exceedingly
pleased with what he had done, and not a
little proud in due time to incarcerate this
fair creature in solitary grandeur within his
carriage, whilst he and his boon companions
rejoiced outside.</p>

<p>The connections formed by his marriage
occasioned additional incentives to expense.
Introduced into a more elevated circle than
he had as yet moved in, and impelled by the
evil ambition of outshining every one with
whom he associated, Winstanley soon found
innumerable new opportunities for spending
money. He became a prey to imaginary
necessities. His carriages, his horses, his
villas and their furniture, his dinners, his
wines, his yachts;&mdash;her <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> in the morning
and her balls in the evening, her gardens
(which were for ever changing), her delicate
health, which required the constant excitement
of continental travel, and yachting excursions;&mdash;the
dress of both; the wild extravagance
of every thing,&mdash;I leave you to
picture to yourselves.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER THE THIRD.</h3>

<p>What is five thousand a year, when a man
spends six? Make it ten, and he will spend
twelve. There is an old story I have heard
my mother tell:&mdash;</p>

<p>A man had a legacy left him, so large, that
upon the strength of it he was enabled to
change his plan of life. He sat down and
calculated the style in which it would henceforward
become him to live. His arrangement
of income and expenditure would have
been perfect, only that the income fell short
a certain, not very large, sum. This was a
sad business. A few hundreds more, and he
would have been quite at ease&mdash;he had them
not&mdash;he began to feel rather poor. A letter
arrives from his man of business. There has
been a mistake; the legacy is of twice the
amount it had been at first stated at. How
will it become him to live now? That is
easily settled&mdash;he has only to double all his
expenses. Alas! And he remains twice as
poor as he was before.</p>

<p>There is no limit to extravagance&mdash;it is a
bottomless chasm which is not to be filled.</p>

<p>The income does not exactly suffice&mdash;and
no man ought to exceed his income. True,
but there are unexpected expenses&mdash;things
that perhaps may never recur. The prudent
man economizes something else; the
imprudent man goes to his capital. He unlocks
that sacred door of which he holds the
enchanted key in his hand&mdash;and ruin rushes
out upon him as a flood.</p>

<p>Julian soon began to touch upon his capital.
It was but in small sums at first, and
yet it is astonishing how rich and easy (for
the time) it made him feel. A thousand or
two thus added to a man's income makes all
mighty smooth, and the consequent diminution
of his future revenue is a trifle, not felt,
and not worth thinking of. Desires increase
with the means to gratify them. He who
takes a thousand or two from his capital, soon
finds it necessary to take more. Income diminishes
as desires gain strength; the habit
of indulgence grows as the means to gratify
it decline.</p>

<p>What with borrowing, and giving bills,
and drawing larger bills to pay the former
bills when they became due, Julian and his
wife had, by the nineteenth year of their
marriage, eaten out the whole core and marrow
of their fortunes. The edifice now
stood, to all appearance, as splendid as ever&mdash;but
it had become a house of cards over a
bottomless pit.</p>

<p>And yet they had children; they had not
wanted those best incentives to a better
course. Their possessions in this way were
not very numerous; people of this description
have seldom overflowing nurseries; the
mother is usually too fine a lady to look after
her children herself. She is contented with
hiring some head nurse, taking her on trust
from some other young woman as heedless
and negligent of her duties as herself; and
to her tender mercies she leaves her babies.</p>

<p>Such a nurse had lorded it in Mrs. Winstanley's
family; an ill-governed family in
every respect, where each servant, from the
highest to the lowest, measured his or her
consequence by the money which was spent
or wasted. Under this nurse's care two lovely
boys had died in their infancy. One little
girl had tumbled somewhere or in some way&mdash;or
had been made to stand too long in the
corner when she was naughty, or to walk
too far when she was tired, or what. I know
not. All I know, is, there was some internal
injury, the cause of which no medical man
who was consulted could detect. The other,
and only remaining child, was a fine, handsome,
spirited girl, of whom Mrs. Nurse
thought proper to be excessively proud and
fond. And how were these little children
educated? Educated is an inappropriate
word. There was no capacity for education
on the part of Nurse; but Mr. and Mrs.
Winstanley, though their dinners were just as
numerous and profuse as ever, saw not the
slightest necessity, whilst the little girls were
young, for the additional expense of any better
governess; and Mrs. Nurse was left to
give all the elementary instruction that was
thought needful&mdash;a task which she undertook
with alacrity; having become somewhat
apprehensive, now the two little boys
were dead and the two young ladies getting
bigger, that she might be superseded.</p>

<p>Her teaching consisted, first in shaking and
scolding Miss Clementina, and keeping her,
with her poor aching hip, prisoner in her
chair till she had learned, a lesson&mdash;which,
for want of comprehending the absurdly
long words of which it seemed purposely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>
composed, it was almost impossible she should
learn; and secondly, in laughing at Miss
Ella's odd blunders as she read, and telling
her every word as it occurred, before she
had time to pronounce it.</p>

<p>As for religion, morality, or knowledge of
right and wrong, Mrs. Nurse thought too
little about such things herself to impart them
to others. I suppose she taught the children
to say their prayers; but I am sure I know
no more than the mother did, whether it was
so or no. Sometimes the children were taken
to stare about them in church; but not often,
for Mrs. Winstanley was in the habit of fulfilling
the commandment very literally, and
making Sunday a day of rest. Commonly
she spent the forenoon in bed; only getting
up in time to dress for a dinner party which
Mr. Winstanley made an especial point of
having on that day. He, as yet, paid this
trifling respect to it; he abstained from going
on Sunday evening to a certain club which
he frequented, to play cards, or roulette, for
unknown sums.</p>

<p>The elder of these children grew up, suffering,
and spiritless; the younger was proud,
insolent, overbearing, and tyrannical&mdash;as much
so as such a little creature could be. They
were fast growing up into all this, and would
have been confirmed in it, had not an accident
arrested the fearful progress.</p>

<p>Spoiled, flattered, allowed to indulge every
evil temper with impunity, Ella's faults were
numberless; more especially to her helpless
sister, whose languid health and feeble spirits
excited little sympathy, and whose complaints
seemed to irritate her.</p>

<p>"I declare you <i>are</i> the most tiresome,
tormenting thing, sitting there looking as
miserable as ever you can, and with that
whining voice of yours, enough to drive one
mad. Why <i>can't</i> you brighten up a little,
and come and play? You really <i>shall</i> come
and play, I want to play! Nurse! O!
she's not there! Do <i>make</i> Clementina come
and play."</p>

<p>"Don't, Ella! don't tease me so; pray
don't! My hip hurts me; I can't. Do let
me alone, pray."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. You make such a fuss about
your hip! I don't believe any thing's the
matter with it; only you're so ill-natured,
you <i>never</i> will do any thing I ask. Nurse, I
say," as the door opened, "do make her.&mdash;O,
it's only Matty! Matty, where's Nurse?"</p>

<p>"She's just stepped out, Miss, and told me
to come, and stay in the day-room with you
till she was back."</p>

<p>And Matty, the new maid, hired but a day
or two before, came in with her sewing in
her hand, and sat down quietly to her work
at the window.</p>

<p>"Matty!" cried Ella, imperiously, "don't
sit there, looking so stupid; but come and
make this tiresome girl play with me. There
she sits, mooning over the fire. If Nurse
were here, she'd soon have her up."</p>

<p>"Don't, pray, Matty," as Matty was rising
from her chair. "Pray, don't. I'll go and
play; but indeed, indeed, it hurts me very
much to move to-day."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Make her get up, Matty,
You must mind me, Matty; you came here
to mind me; so do as you are bid, you ugly
thing."</p>

<p>Matty indeed merited the title of ugly.
She was rather tall, but of a most ungainly
figure, with long bony limbs, ill put together.
It was difficult to say what the features of
her face might have been: they were so
crumpled, and scarred, and seamed. Not a
feature had been left uninjured, except her
eyes: and they were remarkable both for
intelligence and softness.</p>

<p>She put down her work and went up to
Clementina, saying, "What ails you, Miss?
I hope it isn't true that you feign sickness
not to play with your sister?"</p>

<p>The poor girl looked up, and her eyes were
filled with tears. "Feign! I wish I did!"</p>

<p>"Then your hip <i>does</i> hurt you?"</p>

<p>"To be sure it does. So badly! At night,
sometimes, when I'm in bed&mdash;so, so badly."</p>

<p>"And do you know that, Miss Ella?"</p>

<p>"Know it! Why, who does not know it?
She's always talking of it; but, for my part,
I don't believe it's half so bad as she pretends."</p>

<p>"I don't pretend, Ella; you are always
saying that. How cruel you are to set Nurse
against me, by always saying I pretend."</p>

<p>Thus it went on for a minute or two,
whilst Matty stood silently by, her eyes
wandering from one sister to the other.</p>

<p>At last she sighed, and said, "If it had
pleased God to spare me my sister, I wouldn't
have served <i>her</i> so."</p>

<p>Ella turned at this, and lifting up her eyes,
measured Matty from head to foot with indignant
contempt. It would seem as if she
thought it almost too great a presumption in
one so humble to have more care for a sister
than she had.</p>

<p>"Who cares how such as <i>you</i> serve their
sisters?"</p>

<p>"There is One who cares!" said Matty.</p>

<p>Clementina looked at Matty with puzzled
wonder as she spoke. Ella haughtily turned
away, saying, "I should like, for my part,
to hear who this important <i>one</i> is, that you
mention with such a strange emphasis. Some
mighty fine personage, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Miss Clementina! Miss Clementina! only
hear how shocking your sister talks. Do stop
her!"</p>

<p>"Stop me! I should like to see her, or
any one, attempting to stop me. And why,
pray&mdash;and what, pray, am I saying so mighty
bad, Mrs. Matty? You? A charity girl? I
heard Nurse say, but yesterday, that she
wondered her mistress would put up with
such rubbish, and that she loathed the very
look of you, for you put her in mind of the
Blue Coat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thank God," returned Matty, mildly,
"that he raised up that great charity for me,
and many perishing like me, and saved us
from wickedness, and taught us to know His
holy name. For He looks alike on rich and
poor, and will judge both you and me, young
lady."</p>

<p>Both girls were a little awe-stricken at this
speech.</p>

<p>But Ella soon recovered herself, and said,
"she hated to hear people talk like Methodists."</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> you talking about, Matty?"
asked Clementina, gently; "I don't quite
understand."</p>

<p>"Not understand!&mdash;why, sure&mdash;heart
alive!&mdash;it can't be as you are ignorant of
who made and keeps you and all of us!
Sure! Sure!" Matty kept repeating in a
tone of much distress, "I can't believe my
own ears."</p>

<p>"I suppose we know about all that," said
Ella, haughtily.</p>

<p><i>She</i> to teach her!&mdash;the child of charity to
presume to insinuate a want in her! The
idea was intolerable.</p>

<p>She went and sat down at a table at some
little distance, and pretended to be busy
playing with her bird, whose golden cage
stood upon it; but, as she did so, she listened
in spite of herself to the following conversation,
passing between Clementina and
Matty.</p>

<p>"I am so uncomfortable," the young girl
was saying, rather fretfully; "I don't know
what to do with myself. I try this thing and
try that thing, and nothing gives me any
ease or amusement; and I think it very hard&mdash;I
can't help thinking it hard&mdash;that I should
have to suffer every thing, and Ella, there,
nothing; and then, Nurse makes such a favorite
of <i>her</i>, and nobody in the wide world
cares for me. Oh, I am so miserable, sometimes!"</p>

<p>"I used to be like you, once, Miss," said
Matty.</p>

<p>At which Ella gave a contemptuous shrug
of the shoulders.</p>

<p>But Matty did not regard it; and she went
on and said, "Look at my face, Miss Clementina;
it's very horrid and ugly, I know, and
I don't wonder as Nurse calls me rubbish, and
hates to see me in her nice nursery. Many
can't help feeling like that. Do you know
how this was done?"</p>

<p>"No. I suppose small-pox; but it's not
like that, for your face is all cut to pieces. I
don't know how it was done."</p>

<p>"It was done by the dreadful agony of fire.
When I was but a little creature, living, O
Miss! in such a place&mdash;five families of
there were in one low, dark, nasty room, and,
O Miss! it was like the bad place, indeed it was&mdash;such
swearing and blasphemy when the
men come home drunk, and worse, worse,
when the women did so too! Such quarrelling,
and fighting, and cursing, and abusing&mdash;and
the poor children, knocked about at such
times anyhow. But my mother never got
drunk. She was a poor feeble creature, and
mostly sat at home all day crooning, as they
call it, by the fire&mdash;for they kept a good big
fire in winter in the room. And then, when
father come home he was generally very bad
in liquor, and seeking a quarrel with anything&mdash;for
something he must have to quarrel with.
Well! One evening&mdash;O! I shall never forget
it&mdash;a cold, sleety, winter day it was, and
the wind rushing up our court, and the snow
falling thick, and the blackened drops, and
great lumps of snow coming splashing down,
and the foul water oozing in under the doorsill,
and all such a mess; and the poor, tired,
or half-drunk creatures coming in splashed
and dripping, and quarrelling for the nighest
places to the fire, and swearing all the time
to make one's hair stand on end; and father
coming in, all wet and bedabbled, and his
hat stuck at the top of his head, and his cheeks
red, and his eyes staring, though he was
chattering with the cold. Mother was at her
place by the fire, and he comes up in a rage,
like, to turn her out; and she sitting sulky
and wouldn't move; and then there was a
quarrel; and he begun to beat her, and she
begun to shriek out and cry, and the women
to scream and screech. O Miss! in the scuffle&mdash;I
was but a little thing&mdash;somebody
knocks me right into the fire, and my frock
was all in a blaze. It was but a moment, but
it seemed to me such a time!&mdash;all in a blaze
of fire! And I remember nothing more of
it, hardly, but a great noise, and pouring water
over me, and running this way and that.
When I come to myself, where was I?"</p>

<p>Ella turned from her bird, and her attention
seemed riveted upon the story. She forgot
her pride and her insolence in the pleasure
of listening. Clementina seemed hardly
to breathe.</p>

<p>"It was very bad being burned," she said,
at last.</p>

<p>"Horrible, Miss!"</p>

<p>"Go on," cried Ella, impatiently; "what
became of you?"</p>

<p>"When I got out of my daze&mdash;for I believe
it was some time before I came to myself&mdash;I
was lying on father's knee, and he had made
a cradle for me, like, of his great strong
arms: and his head was bent down, and he
was a looking at me, and great big hot scalding
tears were dropping fast upon my poor
face.</p>

<p>"'My poor&mdash;poor little woman,' I heard
him say."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;for my eyes had escaped&mdash;I was
aware that there was a beautiful young lady&mdash;at
least, I thought her more beautiful than
the angels of heaven&mdash;standing on the other
side of me, right opposite my father, and doing
something to my poor arms."</p>

<p>"The lady was very young&mdash;seemed
scarcely more than a child herself, though
she was a young married lady. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span>
beautiful dressed, all in snow-white muslin,
with white satin sash, and bows to her sleeves,
and a white rose in her hair. She had thrown
a large bonnet over it&mdash;but now it was tossed
off, and lay with her shawl upon the floor.
Bad as I was&mdash;O! in such horrid pain&mdash;the
sight of that beautiful dear angel was like a
charm to me; it seemed to chase away the
pain. And then she touched me so delicately,
and spoke so soft and kind! It was music;
heaven's own music was her voice."</p>

<p>"Who was she? who could she be?" cried
Ella.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss, who should she be, but Mr.
Stringer, the apothecary's young bride, as he
had just brought home, and all ready dressed
to go out to her first dinner."</p>

<p>Ella turned away contemptuously, with a
gesture that expressed "was that all?"</p>

<p>Clementina said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How nice of her to come to a poor little
burnt child like you! and into such a dreadful
place too! But I wonder she came in
her best gown!"</p>

<p>"As I heard afterwards, it happened that
Mr. Stringer had been sent for out, and was
not come back; and when they ran screeching
and screaming to the shop, crying a child
was burnt in the court hard by, and Mr.
Stringer was wanted, as there was no one to
go but a little mite of a shop-boy&mdash;for Mr.
Stringer had but just begun business&mdash;what
does she do, but catches up a bottle of stuff
for burns, claps her bonnet over her pretty
white rose, throws her shawl on, and, dressed
in her beautiful new wedding-gown, comes
to this horrid den of dirt and wickedness.
She did me up as best she could, and then
seeing my poor father crying too, and all the
people standing round, and yet not a word to
comfort him, she said, very gently and kindly,
to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Pray don't grieve so: she will be better
by-and-by, poor dear. Don't groan so badly,
poor child! You are very sorry for her, poor
man&mdash;but don't take on so.'</p>

<p>"But the more she spoke in this kind way,
all the more he cried, till at last he seemed
as if he could contain himself no longer, and
he groaned, and almost roared out.</p>

<p>"'Are you the father?' said the young
lady. 'Where is the mother?'</p>

<p>"'Oh! here&mdash;here&mdash;here&mdash;my precious
child, my sweet baby!' cried my poor mother&mdash;and
then went on, 'It was all of you&mdash;you
big brute&mdash;you&mdash;you pushed your own
baby into the red-hot flames, as you were atrying
to get at me!&mdash;yes, my baby&mdash;my
poor&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Don't speak so loud, good woman,' said
the young lady, gently. 'Lay the child upon
the bed,' turning round&mdash;'Bless me!&mdash;why,
there is not a bed!'</p>

<p>"'We are very poor people, ma'am,' a
woman began; 'not a penny to bless ourselves
with. If you'd please to&mdash;'</p>

<p>"I remember my father's voice to this day&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Silence!' he called out, in such a passion,
'would you beg money from the lady to spend
in more gin? Give 'em nothing, ma'am&mdash;give
none of us nothing&mdash;only tell me what's
to be done to save the poor little thing's life.'</p>

<p>"She hesitated, turned, and looked round
the miserable apartment. Too true, there
was not an apology for a bed; there was not
even clean straw.</p>

<p>"'Take her up in your arms,' said she to
my father, 'and follow me.' And she stooped
and picked up her bonnet, and gathered
her great shawl around her, and stepped out
into the rainy, sleety, windy night; and my
father&mdash;for some poor creature had lent an
old shawl to throw over me&mdash;took me and
carried me after her: and a turn of the alley
which led into the court, brought us out into the
street, where the apothecary's shop stood.
I was carried through, and up two pair of
stairs, and into a little mite of a room&mdash;but
all so clean and nice&mdash;and laid, oh! in such
a delicious bed&mdash;and oh! it felt so comfortable&mdash;it
soothed me, like&mdash;and I fell fast asleep."</p>

<p>The two girls were silent for some time.
Ella spoke first.</p>

<p>"What a good woman!" was the remark
she made; "but was she only an apothecary's
wife," she went on; "and was her name
Stringer? What a horrid ugly name! Are
you sure it was Stringer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss&mdash;Stringer and Bullem&mdash;that
was the name over the shop-door."</p>

<p>"What! did they keep a shop?"</p>

<p>"To be sure they did."</p>

<p>"How long did you stay there?"</p>

<p>"I never went away no more, Miss. When
I got better, the lady began to talk to me.
I was a little mite of a thing, but I was
quick enough. She found what bad ways I
was bringing up in; that I had never
once heard of Our Saviour&mdash;not even of my
Maker&mdash;far from ever hearing of the Bible&mdash;or
having it read, or being taught to pray,
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>The two young girls looked at each other,
but said nothing. Matty, in broken and interrupted
sentences, went on:</p>

<p>"So she kept me; for she could not bear
to send me back to that pit of iniquity in
which she had found me. And as I lay in my
bed, one day, and they thought I was
asleep, I heard her arguing the point with
her young husband&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Why, child, you cannot pretend to adopt
all the poor neglected children in this bad
town?' he said.</p>

<p>"'Oh no! I know one can do little&mdash;little
enough: it is but one drop of water in the
vast ocean&mdash;only one little, little drop; but
the oyster took it into its shell, and it became
a pearl. Let me keep this poor little one.
I don't mean to be foolish&mdash;indeed I don't&mdash;I
will only clothe her, and feed her, and send
her to the charity school: indeed, they will
half clothe her there. Do&mdash;do, dear John&mdash;she
is such a miserable object! What is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>
she to do? Let her be taught her duty&mdash;let
her not be a poor ruined wretch, body and
soul at once.'"</p>

<p>"The young lady would have moved a
stone with her talking. Her husband was
not very persuadable; he was not like her.
He was rather a cold-hearted, selfish young
man, but he couldn't refuse her; and so,
when I got better, I was sent to one of the
great charity schools in the city, where I
learned a deal; but my sweet Mrs. Stringer
took a pleasure in teaching me herself, and
so I learned a deal more."</p>

<p>Enough of Matty's tale.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stringer, when she devoted such
means as she could command to the rescue
of one poor child from the misery in which
she was living, and raised her from deplorable
ignorance, as regarded all higher things,
to a knowledge of the supreme and only real
good, little thought how extensive her good
deed would prove; and that in providing for
the religious and moral education of this
wretched child, she was preparing the means
of a religious education&mdash;imperfect, yet still
in some sort a sound religious education&mdash;for
two children of wealth and luxury, as to
such things, most entirely destitute. But so
it proved&mdash;and this was the only religious
education they either of them could be said
ever to receive; so utterly, so entirely, were
all relations of this nature forgotten and neglected
in this house of profusion, where not
one single thing, but the one thing needful
could be said to be wanting.</p>

<p>The story first beguiled the attention, and
then awakened the deep interest of the two
girls. From this day, a sort of acquaintance
arose with Matty, which ripened into true
affection; for Matty was, in fact, a woman of
no common order.</p>

<p>She gradually awakened their sympathies
with regard to subjects to her the most deeply
interesting. She led them, not unwilling,
in those paths which are indeed paths of
pleasantness and peace. She read the Bible
with them, and to them, and she taught them
the vital principle of effectual religion&mdash;the
need and the faith to pray.</p>

<p>I want space to follow the course of these
influences upon the soul. Imperfect they
were. Such a teacher could not lead them
very far; but she brought them on Our Saviour's
way. And though much remained
of wrong, inexperienced and unconverted&mdash;the
change was as from darkness to light.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER THE FOURTH.</h3>

<p>And now several years have elapsed, and
these two girls are grown up to be two beautiful
young women. They had been taken
out of the nursery when it was time to be
thinking seriously of accomplishments; and
the reign of Mrs. Nurse had closed. She was
superseded by a regular governess&mdash;a foreigner.
A French lady was chosen to undertake
the task of forming two English girls to
become English wives and mothers. The
French lady did well all that she was required
to do; for neither Mr. nor Mrs. Winstanley
desired that their beautiful daughters should
receive any thing approaching to what is
usually called a solid education.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winstanley had not ten ideas beyond
the arrangement of a party, and the keeping
of good society. As for Julian Winstanley
himself, he detested reflection, abhorred every
thing approaching to seriousness, only desired
to get through life as brilliantly and as
thoughtlessly as he could.</p>

<p>He was not much at home; but when at
home he required to be constantly amused, or
he found home intolerable. It was not long
before his daughters discovered this.</p>

<p>Till they were what is called introduced,
these fair girls passed their time secluded in
the school-room, and saw very little of their
parents; but when they were once brought
out, and when Mademoiselle was dismissed
and they lived in the drawing-room, they
were soon initiated.</p>

<p>The plan of life was one not unusual among
married people of a certain class. A large and
splendidly furnished house, in a fashionable
square in London, was <i>home</i>&mdash;at which about
six months of every year were passed; the remaining
six being spent either in travelling,
or at watering-places, or at some hired house
in the country. They lived as a privileged
order, severed, as by a gulf impassable, from
the lowest orders around them, and in little
communication with the highest. The last
condition was not of much importance, but
the other was fatal.</p>

<p>What can grow out of such a life, that is
really wholesome and good? Many, many
residents in London, escape this mischief.
They have broken down the wall of separation
which used to hide the very existence
of want and misery and sin from the happier
and the better; and the obscure dwellings of
the London poor have their visiting angels,
as well as those in the country. But a great
many families still neglect this weighty duty,
and live without thought of such things.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winstanley had led the regular party-going
London life for the last sixteen or seventeen
years. She was beginning to get rather
tired of it, when the new excitement arose
of having to "bring out" her daughters.</p>

<p>This bringing out of her daughters became
an excuse for all kinds of amusing changes
and improvements. Her receiving-rooms had
to be newly furnished, a new open carriage
to be bought, the Queen's drawing-rooms to
be attended with more assiduity than ever.</p>

<p>The girls were two lovely creatures; they
seemed to excuse, if any thing could, the expenses
thus incurred on their behalf. So said
the mother, and so thought the father. The
love he felt for his daughters was perhaps the
only tender feeling he had ever experienced
in his life; for, in general, he might be said
to love nothing, not even himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span></p>

<p>It might have been the dawn of a better
life, this well-spring of pure affections, could
he have worthily indulged them. But neither
his own nor his wife's habits admitted of that.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winstanley would have thought it a
disgrace if she had been one single evening
disengaged whilst they were in London. Even
in the dead winter she managed to keep up
the ball; what with little parties and concerts,
the opera, the French plays, and so forth, she
contrived to escape the horror of a domestic
evening. As for Mr. Winstanley, he seldom
or never dined at home; except when there
was a dinner-party. He spent his evenings
at his clubs, engaged&mdash;he too well knew how.</p>

<p>The two girls presented a striking contrast
to each other. Clementina was fair and delicate,
with soft hair, and those tender blue
eyes, which to me are the most charming of
all eyes. Ella was a noble creature; a figure
and form the most perfect that I ever beheld&mdash;features
of matchless symmetry&mdash;eyes dark,
large, and lustrous&mdash;hair in floods of rich
brown waves&mdash;a hand that was a model, from
which statuaries contested to be allowed to
copy&mdash;and a spirit, energy, and feeling in her
gestures and countenance, that won your heart
before you were aware.</p>

<p>It was upon her that Julian Winstanley
doted. The other girl he thought, and called,
a sweet girl, but his Ella was his darling.
Nothing was too good for Ella; nothing was
to be spared that could please or adorn Ella.
To ride with her in the Park; to visit the
box where she sat at the opera; sometimes
in a party to hear her sing; seemed to give
him a new pleasure.</p>

<p>Yet there was nothing in all this, unhappily,
to rouse him to a better life; to break
the chain of evil habits in which he was involved.
Ella was a child of this world; an
impetuous, proud, haughty beauty; a contemptuous
disregarder of the weak, the wanting,
and, above all, the low, or the ugly;&mdash;living
for the day, as her father lived for the
day&mdash;she for the day of vanity and pleasure;
he for the day of vanity and sin. There was
that difference, indeed, and it was a vast one;
but he did not feel it.</p>

<p>There was no pure and holy influence of a
higher and nobler life, diffused from the beautiful
being. She was no angel of light. She
was merely, to all appearance, a very fine,
fashionable girl.</p>

<p>And Clementina, in her gentleness and softness,
was little more. The good seed which
Matty had sown, had fructified at first, but
the briars and thorns were gathering fast
around it. The pleasures of life were choking
it up. It was in danger of being altogether
lost.</p>

<p>Matty had long been gone. She had married
a respectable tradesman, and was in a
flourishing, though small, way of business.
She would have been altogether forgotten
long ago, only that she would not suffer this.
She found herself still welcomed when she
did come; for both the girls loved her, and
she perfectly adored them. So she came,
bringing her little offerings, from time to
time&mdash;little matters such as she dealt in, in
her shop&mdash;humble, but, for her sake, welcome.
These two girls had both hearts.
Where they got them I don't know.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER THE FIFTH.</h3>

<p>"Oh, Ella! Ella!&mdash;what's the use of your
turning your head from me?&mdash;Why, I can see
you are coloring crimson&mdash;as if I had no
eyes! Oh! he <i>is</i> charming, is not he?"</p>

<p>"How tiresome you can be, Clementina!
I am sure I don't care. No, not.... Besides,
he's your flirt, not mine."</p>

<p>"Is he? I wish he were! But I know
better. He loves you, Ella; and what's more,
you love him. And if <i>you</i> don't know it&mdash;which
perhaps you don't&mdash;<i>I</i> do, and <i>he</i> does."</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> does!&mdash;I like that!&mdash;<i>he</i> does!&mdash;Upon
my word! <i>I</i> like him, and <i>he</i> knows it! I
do no such thing."</p>

<p>"Take care what you say. Walls have ears."</p>

<p>"Pooh!&mdash;nonsense! And if they have, I
tell you I don't care."</p>

<p>"You don't?&mdash;you are sure you don't? Oh,
very well! If that be really so, then I had
better keep my message to myself."</p>

<p>"Message!&mdash;what message?"</p>

<p>"You know a man does not like to be refused;
and so, if you really do <i>not</i> care for
him, why, I had better hold my peace. He is
young, and he is volatile enough.... And,
indeed, I have wondered, Ella, sometimes,
how you ever came to take a fancy to him;
but I am forgetting. It was my mistake.
You never <i>have</i> taken a fancy to him."</p>

<p>"How you do run on!" she said, taking the
last rose out of her hair; for she was standing
before the glass, undoing her braids; the
sisters, having dismissed their attendant, that
they might have a comfortable chat together.
And then the hair came all tumbling over her
shoulders, and upon her white muslin dressing-gown,
and she looked most beautiful&mdash;half
pleasant, half angry&mdash;as she turned round;
and, trying to frown with her eyes, whilst
her lips smiled, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cle., you <i>are</i> the most intolerable girl in
the world."</p>

<p>Cle. smiled, looked down, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"You may as well tell me, though."</p>

<p>"No, I won't, unless you will be a true girl&mdash;own
what you ought to own&mdash;say what
you ought to say&mdash;that you do not <i>quite</i> hate
him. You really may say that&mdash;and then we
will see about it."</p>

<p>"Hate him! Did I say I hated him?"</p>

<p>"Or, pretended you did. Or, that he was
indifferent to you."</p>

<p>"Well, well; I don't hate him, then."</p>

<p>"Then come here, and sit down by me, and
I will tell you that Lionel loves you, and
adores you&mdash;and all that. Very easily said.
But far more than that&mdash;and with great difficulty
said&mdash;he wishes to make you his wife!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah me!"&mdash;and again the color flashed
into her face, and such an expression was
visible in her eyes!</p>

<p>Suddenly she threw her arms around her
sister, and embraced her tenderly.</p>

<p>"You dear, dear girl," she whispered&mdash;"Oh,
I am so&mdash;so happy! But tell me&mdash;tell
me&mdash;all, from the beginning. Lionel!&mdash;is it
possible?"</p>

<p>"You thought we were very busy talking
together to-night, at Mrs. White's ball, didn't
you?&mdash;You were a little jealous, were you not,
you silly thing? Ah, my Ella! My proud&mdash;proud
Ella! To have made such a tumble
into love!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!&mdash;how you talk! But tell me
all he said. Every single word of it!"</p>

<p>"He said he loved you more than his life,
and all that sort of thing; and that I must
tell you so to-night; and, if you would give
him the least atom of encouragement, I was
to take no notice, and he would speak to papa
and mamma immediately; but, if you hated
him as much as I said I was sure you did...."</p>

<p>"How could you say such a stupid thing?"</p>

<p>"I thought that was what I ought to say."</p>

<p>"How foolish you are, Cle.! Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, in <i>that</i> case, I was to write. Shall
I write?"</p>

<p>She did not write.</p>

<p>And from this time the existence of Ella
was changed.</p>

<p>She loved, with all the fervor and energy
of her nature; and life took at once a new
color. True love is of the infinite. None
can have deeply loved&mdash;when or how in other
respects it may have been&mdash;but they have
entered into the unseen world; have breathed
a new breath of life; have tasted of the
true existence.</p>

<p>What is often called love, may do nothing
of all this&mdash;but I am speaking of <i>true</i> love.</p>

<p>Lionel seemed at that time scarcely worthy
of the passion he had inspired. Yet he had
many excellent qualities. He was warm-hearted,
generous to excess, had good parts, a brilliant
way of talking, and was a favorite with
all the world.</p>

<p>He had not the splendid gifts which nature
had bestowed upon Julian Winstanley. By
the side of her father, even in the eyes of
Ella, the bright halo which surrounded her
lover would seem somewhat to pale. The
young man even appeared to feel this, in some
degree, himself. He always, yet with a certain
grace, took the second place, when in her
father's presence. Ella loved her father, and
seemed to like that it should be so.</p>

<p>"Oh, my sister! oh, my friend! what&mdash;what
shall we do? Oh, misery! misery!
what is to become of us all?"</p>

<p>Clementina's eyes were swimming with
tears; but she would not give way. In passive
endurance she excelled her sister.</p>

<p>She held her arms clapped closely round
her; whilst Ella poured a torrent of tears
upon her bosom.</p>

<p>"My father! my beautiful, clever, indulgent
father, that I was so proud of&mdash;that I
loved so&mdash;who spared nothing upon either of
us&mdash;alas! alas! how little, little did I guess
whence the money came!"</p>

<p>Clementina trembled and shivered as her
sister poured forth these passionate lamentations;
but she neither wept nor spoke for
some time. At last she said:</p>

<p>"Ella, I have been uneasy about things for
some time. We are young, and we have not
much experience in the ways of the world;
but since our poor mother died, and I have
had in some degree to manage the house, I
have been every day becoming more uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"You have?" said Ella, lifting up her head:
"and you never told me!"</p>

<p>"Why should I have told you? why should
I have disturbed your dream of happiness,
my dear Ella? Besides, I hoped that it concerned
me alone&mdash;that things might hold on
a little while longer&mdash;at least, till you were
provided for, and safe."</p>

<p>"Safe! and what was to become of you?"</p>

<p>"I did not much think of that. I had a
firm friend, I knew, in you, Ella; and then,
lately, since mamma's death; since you have
been engaged to dear Lionel, and I have been
much alone, I have thought of old things&mdash;old
things that good Matty used to talk about.
I have been endeavoring to look beyond myself,
and this world; and it has strengthened
me."</p>

<p>"You are an excellent creature, Cle.!"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"But, my father! what is to be done? Can
any thing be done?"</p>

<p>"No, my love. I fear nothing can be done."</p>

<p>"He loves me!" said Ella, raising up her
head again, her eyes beaming with a new
hope. "I will try&mdash;I will venture. It is
perhaps great presumption in a child; but
my father loves me, and I love him...."</p>

<p>Again Clementina shook her head.</p>

<p>"You are so faint-hearted&mdash;you are so discouraging.
You give up every thing without
an attempt to save yourself or others. That
is your way!" cried Ella, with her own impetuosity,
and some of her old injustice.
Then, seeing sorrow and pain working upon
her sister's face as she spoke thus, she stopped
herself, and cried&mdash;"Oh! I am a brute&mdash;worse
than a brute&mdash;to say this. Dear Cle.,
forgive me; but don't, pray don't discourage
me, when I want all my courage. I will go&mdash;I
will go this moment, and speak to my
father...."</p>

<p>Clementina pressed her sister's hand as she
started up to go. She feared the effort would
be vain,&mdash;vain as those she had herself made;
yet there was no knowing. Ella was so beautiful,
so correct, so eloquent, so prevailing!</p>

<p>She followed her with her eyes, to the
door, with feelings of mingled hope and apprehension.</p>

<p>Down the splendid stairs, with their gilded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</a></span>
balustrades, and carpets of the richest hue
and texture, rushed the impetuous Ella.
Through the hall&mdash;all marbles and guilding&mdash;and
her hand was upon the lock of the
library door. She was about to turn it, without
reflection: but a sudden fear of intruding
came over her&mdash;she paused and knocked.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" exclaimed an irritated
voice from within; "go away&mdash;I can see no
one just now."</p>

<p>"It is I, papa&mdash;Ella; pray let me come
in."</p>

<p>And she opened the door.</p>

<p>He was standing in the middle of the lofty
and magnificent apartment, which was adorned
on every side with pictures in gorgeous
frames; with busts, vases, and highly ornamented
bookcases fitted with splendidly
bound books&mdash;seldom, if ever, opened. His
pale, wan, haggard face and degraded figure,
formed a fearful contrast to the splendid scene
around him, showing like a mockery of his
misery. A small table, richly inlaid, stood
beside him; in one hand he held a delicate
cup of fine china; in the other, a small chemist's
phial.</p>

<p>He started as she entered, and turned to
her an angry and confused countenance, now
rapidly suffused with a deep crimson flush;
but, as if electrified by a sudden and horrid
suspicion, she rushed forward, and impetuously
seized his shaking arm.</p>

<p>The cup fell to the floor, and was broken
to atoms; but he clenched the phial still faster
in his trembling hand, as he angrily uttered
the words:</p>

<p>"How dare you come in here?"</p>

<p>"Oh! papa&mdash;papa!"&mdash;she had lost all
other terror before that of horrible suspicion
which had seized her&mdash;"what are you
about? what is that?" stretching out her
arms passionately, and endeavouring to wrench
the phial from his fingers.</p>

<p>"What are you about? what do you
mean?" he cried, endeavouring to extricate
his hand. "Let me alone&mdash;leave me alone!
what are you about? Be quiet, I say, or by...."
And with the disengaged hand he
tore her fingers from his, and thrust her violently
away.</p>

<p>She staggered, and fell, but caught herself
upon her knees, and flinging her arms round
his, lifted up her earnest imploring face, crying,
"Father&mdash;father! papa-papa! for my
sake&mdash;for your sake&mdash;for all our sakes; oh,
give it me! give it to me!"</p>

<p>"Give you what? what do you mean?
what are you thinking about?" endeavouring
to escape from her clasping arms. "Have
done, and let me alone. Will you have done?
will you let me alone?" fiercely, angrily endeavoring
again to push her away.</p>

<p>"No! never&mdash;never&mdash;never! till you give
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That!"</p>

<p>"That!" he cried. Then as if recollecting
himself, he endeavored, as it seemed, to
master his agitation, and said more calmly,
"Let me be, Ella! and if it will be any satisfaction
to you, I will thrust the bottle into
the fire. But, you foolish girl, what do you
gain by closing one exit, when there are open
ten thousand as good?"</p>

<p>Disengaging himself from her relaxing
arms, he walked up to the fire-place, and
thrust the phial between the bars. It broke
as he did so, and there was a strong smell of
bitter almonds. She had risen from her
knees. She followed him, and again laid
that hand upon his arm&mdash;that soft, fair hand,
of whose beauty he was wont to be so proud.
It trembled violently now; but as if impelled
with unwonted courage, and an energy inspired
by the occasion, she ventured upon
that which it was long since anyone ever had
presumed to offer to Julian Winstanley&mdash;upon
a plain-spoken remonstrance.</p>

<p>"Papa," she said, "promise me that you
will never&mdash;never&mdash;never again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Make an attempt upon your life&mdash;if I
must speak out," she said, with a spirit that
astonished him.</p>

<p>"Attempt my life? What should I attempt
my life for?" said he, and he glanced round
the scene of luxury which surrounded him.
He was continuing, in a tone of irony&mdash;but
it would not do. He sank upon a sofa, and
covering his face with his hands, groaned&mdash;"Yes&mdash;yes,
Ella! all you say is true. I am
a wretch who is unworthy to&mdash;and more&mdash;who
<i>will</i> not live." He burst forth at last
with a loud voice; and his hands falling from
his face, displayed a countenance dark with
a sort of resolute despair. "No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&mdash;death,
death!&mdash;annihilation&mdash;and forgetfulness!
Why did you come in to interrupt me,
girl?" he added, roughly seizing her by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;I know not&mdash;something&mdash;Oh!
it was the good God, surely, who impelled
me," she cried, bursting into tears. "Oh,
papa! papa! Do not! do not! Think of us
all&mdash;your girls&mdash;Cle. and I. You used to
love us, papa&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you know what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no. I believe you have lost a great
deal of money at cards."</p>

<p>"Cards&mdash;was it? Let it be. It may as
well be cards. Yes, child, I <i>have</i> lost a large
sum of money at cards&mdash;and more," he added,
setting his teeth, and speaking in a sort
of hissing whisper&mdash;"more than I can exactly
pay."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa! don't say so. Consider&mdash;only
look round you. Surely you have the means
to pay! We can sell&mdash;we can make any
sacrifice&mdash;any sacrifice on earth to pay. Only
think, there are all these things. There is
all the plate&mdash;my mother's diamonds&mdash;there
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He let her run on a little while; then, in a
cool, almost mocking tone, he said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have given a bill of sale for all that,
long ago."</p>

<p>"A bill of sale! What is a bill of sale?"</p>

<p>"Well! It's a thing which passes one
man's property into the hands of another
man, to make what he can of it. And the
poor dupe who took my bill of sale, took it
for twice as much as the things would really
bring; but the rascal thought he had no alternative.
I was a fool to give it to him, for
the dice were loaded. If it were the last
word I had to speak, I would say it&mdash;the dice
were loaded&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! you want to hear all about it, do
you? Well it's a bad business. I thought
I had a right to a run of luck&mdash;after all my
ill fortune. I calculated the chances; they
were overwhelmingly in my favor. I staked
my zero against another man's thousands&mdash;never
mind how many&mdash;and I lost, and have
only my zero to offer in payment. That is
to say, my note of hand; and how much do
you think that is worth, my girl? I would
rather&mdash;I would rather," he added, passionately,
changing his tone of levity for one of
the bitterest despair&mdash;"I would rather be
dead&mdash;dead, dead&mdash;than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, papa! papa! say it not! say it not!
It is real. Such things are not mere words.
They are real, father, father!&mdash;Die! You
must not die."</p>

<p>"I have little cause to wish to die," he
said, relapsing again into a sort of gloomy
carelessness; "so that I could see any other
way out of it. To be sure, one might run&mdash;one
might play the part of a cowardly, dishonorable
rascal, and run for it, Ella, if you
like that better. Between suicide and the
escapade of a defaulter, there is not much to
choose; but I will do as you like."</p>

<p>"I would not willingly choose your dishonor,"
said she, shuddering; "but between the
dishonor of the one course or the other, there
seems little to choose. Only&mdash;only&mdash;if you
lived, in time you might be able to pay.
Men have lived, and labored, until they have
paid all."</p>

<p>"Live and labor&mdash;very like me! Live, and
labor, until I have paid all&mdash;extremely like
me! Lower a mountain by spadefuls."</p>

<p>"Even spadefuls," she said; her understanding
and her heart seemed both suddenly
ripened in this fearful extremity&mdash;"even
spadefuls at a time have done something&mdash;have
lowered mountains, where there was determination
and perseverance.</p>

<p>"But suppose there was neither. Suppose
there was neither courage, nor goodness, nor
determination, nor perseverance. Suppose
the man had lived a life of indolent self-indulgence,
until, squeeze him as you would,
there was not one drop of virtue left in him.
Crush him, as fate is crushing me at this moment;
and I tell you, you will get nothing
out of him. Nothing&mdash;nothing. He is more
worthless than the most degraded beast.
Better to die as a beast, and go where the
beasts go."</p>

<p>She turned ghastly pale at this terrible
speech&mdash;but, "No," she faltered out&mdash;"no&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"You will not have me die, then?" he said,
pursuing the same heartless tone; but it was
forced, if that were any excuse for him.
"Then you prefer the other scheme? I
thought, he went on, "to have supped with
Pluto to-night; but you prefer that it should
be on board an American steamer."</p>

<p>"I do," she gasped, rather than uttered.</p>

<p>"You do&mdash;you are sure you do?" said he,
suddenly assuming a tone of greater seriousness.
"You wish, Ella, to preserve this
worthless life? Have you considered at
what expense?"</p>

<p>"Expense! How! Who could think of
that?" she answered.</p>

<p>"Oh! not the expense of money, child&mdash;at
the expense of the little thing called 'honor.'
Listen to me, Ella,"&mdash;and again he took
her arm, and turned her poor distracted face,
to his. "You see I am ready to die&mdash;at least,
was ready to die&mdash;but I have no wish to die.
Worthless as this wretched life of mine it, it
has its excitements, and its enjoyments, to me.
When I made up my mind to end it, I assure
you, child, I did the one only generous thing
I ever was guilty of in my life; for I did it
for you girls' sakes, as much or more than for
my own. Suicide, some think a wicked thing&mdash;I
don't. How I got my life, I don't know;
the power of getting rid of it is mine, and I
hold myself at liberty to make use of it or
not, at my own good pleasure. As for my
ever living to pay my debt, it's folly to talk
of it. I have not, and never shall acquire, the
means. I have neither the virtue nor the industry.
I tell you, I am utterly good for
nothing. I am a rascal&mdash;a scoundrel, and a
despicable knave. I played for a large sum&mdash;meaning
to take it if I won it&mdash;and not being
able to pay, I lost it&mdash;and that, I have
still sense of honor enough left to call a rascally
proceeding. Now there is one way, and
one way only, of cancelling all this in the
eye of the world. When a man destroys
himself, the world is sorry for him&mdash;half inclined
to forgive him&mdash;to say the least of it,
absolves his family. But&mdash;if he turn tail&mdash;and
sneak away to America, and has so little
sense"&mdash;he went on, passionately and earnestly&mdash;"of
all that is noble, and faithful,
and honorable, that he can bear to drag on a
disgraced, contemptible existence, like a mean,
pitiful, cowardly, selfish wretch, as he is&mdash;why,
then&mdash;then&mdash;he is utterly blasted, and
blackened over with infamy! Nobody feels
for him, nobody pities him&mdash;the world speaks
out, and curses the rascal as heartily as he
deserves&mdash;and all his family perish with him.
Now, Ella, choose which you will."</p>

<p>"I choose America," she said with firmness.</p>

<p>"And how am I to got to America? and
how am I to live there when I am there?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</a></span>
To be sure, there are your mother's diamonds,"
he added.</p>

<p>"Those are included in the bill of sale.
Did you not say so?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I did. But if a man is to
live, he must have something to live upon.
If he is to take flight, he must have wings to
fly with."</p>

<p>"I will provide both."</p>

<p>"You will?"</p>

<p>"I am of age. What I have&mdash;which was
not your gift&mdash;is at least my own. Lionel
has been generous; I have the means to pay
your passage."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye&mdash;Lionel! But afterwards, how
am I to live? He will not like&mdash;no man
would like&mdash;to have to maintain a wife's father,
and that man a defaulter too. You
should think of that, Ella."</p>

<p>"I do! I will never ask him."</p>

<p>"Then who is to maintain me? I tell you,
I shall never manage to do it myself."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"My poor child!" he cried&mdash;one short
touch of nature had reached him at last&mdash;"what
are you talking of?"</p>

<p>"I hope, and believe, that I shall be able to
do it."</p>

<p>"I stood with my household gods shattered
around me," is the energetic expression of
that erring man, who had brought the fell
catastrophe upon himself.</p>

<p>And so stood Ella now&mdash;in the centre of
her own sitting-room, like some noble figure
of ruin and despair; yet with a light, the light
divine, kindling in an eye cast upward.</p>

<p>Yes! all her household gods&mdash;all the
idols she had too dearly loved and cherished,
were shattered around her, and she felt that
she stood alone, to confront the dreadful fate
which had involved all she loved.</p>

<p>What a spectacle presented itself to her
imagination, as drearily she looked round!
On one side, defaced and disfigured, soiled,
degraded, was the once beautiful and animated
figure of her father,&mdash;the man so brilliant,
and to her so splendid a specimen of
what human nature, in the full affluence of
nature's finest gifts, might be. Upon another
side her lover!&mdash;her husband! who was to
have been her heart's best treasure! who never
was to be hers now. No! upon that her
high spirit had at once resolved; never. Impoverished
and degraded, as she felt herself
to be, never would she be Lionel's wife. The
name which would, in a few hours' time, be
blackened by irremediable dishonor, should
never be linked to his. One swell of tender
feeling, and it was over! All that is wrong,
and all that is right, in woman's pride, had
risen in arms at once against this.</p>

<p>The last figure that presented itself, was
that of her delicate and gentle sister. But
here there was comfort. Clementina was of
a most frail and susceptible temperament, and
eminently formed to suffer severely from adverse
external circumstances; but she had a
true and faithful heart; and if to Ella she
would be obliged to cling for support, she
would give consolation in return.</p>

<p>Ella looked upward&mdash;she looked up to God!</p>

<p>That holy name was not a stranger to her
lips. It had been once, until the child of
charity had taught the rich man's daughter
some little knowledge of it. But such ideas
had never been thoroughly realized by her
mind; and now, when in the extremity of
her destitution, she looked up&mdash;when, "out
of the depths she cried unto Him,"&mdash;alas! He
seemed so far, far off, and her distresses were
so terribly near!</p>

<p>Yet even then, imperfect as all was, a beginning
was made. The thick darkness of
her soul seemed a little broken,&mdash;communion
with the better and higher world was at least
begun. There was a light&mdash;dim and shadowy&mdash;but
still a light. There was a strength,
vacillating and uncertain, but still a strength,
coming over her soul.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER THE SIXTH.</h3>

<p>And now that wretched man, broken with
disease and misery, sat there, with the lady,
who, patient and pitying even to the worst
of her fellow-creatures, had been moved by
the sincerity of his distress. The extremity
of his misery had raised so much compassion
in her heart, as to overcome the resentment
and indignation which she had at first felt,
on recognizing him.</p>

<p>He had entreated her to tell him every
thing she knew of the fate of one whom he
had that morning followed to the grave.
For wretched as was his attire, defiled with
dirt, and worn with travel, he had left the
house, and had followed, a tearless, but heartbroken
mourner, the simple procession which
attended the once lovely and glorious creature
whom he had called daughter to her
resting-place.</p>

<p>He had stood by, at her funeral, whilst ill-taught
children stared and scoffed, until the
busy mercenaries had pushed and elbowed
him aside. He had seen his best and loveliest
one consigned, ashes to ashes, dust to dust;
he had waited quietly until all had dispersed,
and every one was gone home. He had no
home&mdash;and he yet stood by, and watched the
sexton completing his work and cheerfully
whistling as he proceeded with it.</p>

<p>For it was now a gleaming bright day, and
the sun had burst forth, and beamed upon the
lofty tower of the church-steeple. It gilded
the church-vane and weathercock; it sparkled
from the windows of the houses around
the graveyard; it glistened on the lowly
graves.</p>

<p>Cheerfulness was around him, for the bright
sun of heaven cheers and ennobles every
thing upon which his beams fall. And there
was a soft wind, too, which stirred among
the leaves of a few poplars, that stood hard
by, whispering sweet secrets of nature, even
in that dismal spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood there, motionless and tearless,
until the sexton had finished his task, had
shouldered his spade, and, still whistling, had
walked away. Then he sat down upon the
little mound, and hid his face in his hands.
He sat there for some time&mdash;for a long, long
time&mdash;and then slowly arose, and with feeble
and uncertain steps retraced the way he had
come, and found himself at the door of the
handsome house, whence he had followed the
funeral in the morning.</p>

<p>He made his way to the lady, who happened
to be still there, and who now (as I have
said), indignation having yielded to compassion,
was prepared to satisfy the yearning anxiety
he had expressed to hear all she could
tell him of his once proud and beautiful child.</p>

<p>"You know where you are, and what I am,
and what I and the other ladies whom you
have seen with me employ ourselves upon
when we come here."</p>

<p>"No," he said, looking round. "It never
struck me to inquire, or even to reflect upon
what I saw."</p>

<p>"This house is a kind of hospital."</p>

<p>He started&mdash;and a faint flush passed over
his face.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it was natural&mdash;as things
had gone on&mdash;a consequence inevitable. Then
she died at last in the hospital?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly that&mdash;as you would interpret
the word. This house is, indeed, a species of
hospital; it is intended as a refuge for the
sick and dying, who have nowhere else to go;
but it does not exactly resemble an ordinary
hospital. In the first place, the services performed
are not altogether gratuitous; in the
second, every patient has a room to herself.
We are only women, except the medical attendants:
and we admit none but women&mdash;and
those women of a higher class, of gentle
breeding, and refined habits, who have fallen
into poverty, and yet who have not been
hardened in their sensations by habits, so as
that the edge of privation is blunted; or what,
perhaps, is still more difficult to bear, that
painful sense of publicity unfelt, which renders
shelter in an ordinary hospital a source
of suffering to them&mdash;which&mdash;God be thanked!&mdash;it
does not necessarily prove to those
for whom such places of refuge were intended.
This house would have been more justly called
an asylum than a hospital, for it is intended
as a shelter for the sick and destitute; but
yet those who are received into it are expected
to contribute to their own support."</p>

<p>He made no answer to this explanation.
After all, it, interested him little now to know
that his Ella had not been a mere object of
the charity which is extended to paupers.
His pride had died within him, for his nature
had been much changed; but, only as such
natures change. His faults had withered
away, but no good qualities seemed as yet to
burst forth to flourish in their stead. The
soul had been so utterly ruined and devastated,
the portion of living waters had been so
completely dried up, that he seemed merely
to have lost the inclination to do wrong&mdash;that
was all.</p>

<p>"We are a small party of friends," the lady
went on; "some of us in the heyday of prosperity,
but who, amid all the triumphs of
youth, wealth, and beauty, have not quite
forgotten the poor, the sick, and the miserable:
others, who, like myself, are fallen into
the yellow leaf of life&mdash;whose years cannot
of necessity be many&mdash;may be very few&mdash;and
who would fain do something in the great
vineyard before they are called away. It is
our practice for some of us to visit this place
every day, to see our patients, attend to their
wants and comforts, and, where it is desired,
administer by our conversation such helps
and solace as we can. I come here pretty often,
for I am not one who is very much occupied
upon this earth; and, as I love to sit
with the sufferers, and am more aged than
the majority of them, they seem to lean upon
me a good deal. They love to have me with
them; and many of the younger ones have
treated me with a confidence, which has excited,
I can scarcely say whether more satisfaction
or pain."</p>

<p>He still spoke not, but listened with deep
attention.</p>

<p>"A few months ago," she continued, "the
matron of the establishment came to me one
morning, and said that a young lady had been
received here some days ago, whom she wished
me very much to visit. I had but the day
before returned from an excursion into the
country, and had been absent from my post
about a fortnight. I asked, at whose recommendation
the patient had been received. She
said&mdash;that of Lady R., but that Lady R. knew
nothing about her. It was at the earnest solicitation
of the wife of the baker who supplied
her family with bread, that Lady R.
had given the order; the woman, who was a
very plain sort of person, but highly respectable
in her way, having assured her that it
was a case of the most urgent necessity: that
the young lady was utterly penniless and destitute,
and in an almost hopeless state of
health. She had brought on a decline by
over-exertion to maintain a sick sister, and
pay some debts of that sister's, which she
thought herself bound in honor to discharge&mdash;'and
other expenses,' she added, somewhat
mysteriously,&mdash;promising that she would advance
the required guinea a week; for, as for
the young lady, she did not believe that she
had five shillings left in the world."</p>

<p>He struck his hand flat at the top of his
head, and held it there, leaning his elbow upon
the table, so that his arm covered in part
his face, which was painfully contracted; but
he neither spoke, nor groaned, nor even
sighed.</p>

<p>"I went up to the young lady's room immediately.
Our rooms are each provided
with a single bed, a sofa, an easy chair, a table,
and such other requisites as make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</a></span>
chamber at once a bedroom and a sitting-room.</p>

<p>"The matron knocked gently at the door;
but no one answered it; she therefore gently
turned the handle of the lock, and we went in.</p>

<p>"The window was open. Hers looked
upon those green trees you see at the back of
the house, and the fresh air came pleasantly
in: but it seemed unheeded by the sufferer.
She was clothed in a long white sleeping-gown.
One arm was thrown above her
head; her hair had gotten from her comb,
and fell in waves and curls of the utmost
beauty and luxuriance almost to her feet.
She lay with her face upward, resting upon
the back of her head, almost as motionless as
a corpse: her features were fixed; her eyes
rested upon the top of the bed. She seemed
lost in thought. Never in my life have I seen
any thing so supremely beautiful."</p>

<p>"Ella&mdash;Ella!" he just muttered.</p>

<p>"When we approached the side of the bed,
she first perceived us, gave a little start,
glanced at the matron, and then, with a look
of rather displeased surprise at me&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I beg your pardon if I intrude upon you,'
I said. 'Mrs. Penrose asked me to pay you
a visit. I am but just returned from the
country. I spend a good deal of my time
when in town with the sick ladies here, and
they seem to like to have me; but if you do
not I will go away directly.'</p>

<p>"She made an impatient and half-contemptuous
motion of the head as I used the words
'sick ladies;' but she fixed her large, lustrous
eyes upon me as I went on speaking&mdash;saying
nothing, however, when I concluded, but
keeping those large dark eyes fixed upon my
face.</p>

<p>"'Shall I go?' I said, after a little time
thus spent.</p>

<p>"She made a gesture as if to stop me&mdash;but
without moving those large mournful eyes, in
which I could see that tears were slowly
gathering.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Penrose had already left the room.
I said no more; but took a chair, sat down
by the bedside, and laid mine upon her thin,
fevered, but most exquisitely-formed hand.</p>

<p>"I gave a gentle, gentle pressure; it was
faintly, very faintly returned; and then the
tears, which had so slowly gathered into her
eyes, fell in a few large drops over her faded
cheeks.</p>

<p>"'This is lonely, desolate work, do what
we will,' I said, as a sort of answer to these
few large tears, falling so quietly and still,
and without convulsion of features&mdash;the tears
of a strong but softened mind. 'To be sick,
and without familiar faces&mdash;to be sick and
among strangers&mdash;is a sorrowful, sorrowful
thing&mdash;but we do our best.'</p>

<p>"'O, you are good&mdash;very good,' she said.</p>

<p>"'There is nothing <i>I</i> feel so much myself
as this destitution of the heart; solitude in
sickness is to me almost more than I can bear;
and, therefore, it is, perhaps, that I am almost
troublesome in offering my society to
those here who have not many friends and
visitors&mdash;especially to the young. I can bear
solitude myself better now, badly as I do
bear it, than when I was young. Society
seems, to the young, like the vital air upon
which they exist.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, perhaps so,' she said, after musing
a little&mdash;'yes. So long as there was one near
me whom I loved, I could get on&mdash;better or
worse&mdash;but I could get on. But she is gone.
Others whom I have loved are far&mdash;far away.
The solitude of the heart! yes, that kills one
at last.'</p>

<p>"'Then will you try to make a friend of
me? A new friend can never be like an old
friend. Yet, when the old wine is drawn
down to the dregs, we accept the new, although
we still say the old is better.'</p>

<p>"'How very kindly you speak to me! You
have none of the pride of compassion,' she
said, fixing her lovely eyes, filled with an
earnest, intelligent expression, full upon mine.
'You will not humble me, whilst you serve
me.'</p>

<p>"'Humble you! My dear young lady!
That, I hope, indeed, would be far from me&mdash;from
every one of us.'</p>

<p>"'I dare say so&mdash;as you say it. I have
seen none of the ladies, only the matron, Mrs.
Penrose, and a friend of mine, to whom I
owe much; but they are both so inferior to
myself in habits and education, that I don't
think they could humble me if they tried.
The insolence of my inferiors, I can defy&mdash;the
condescensions of my superiors, are what
I dread.'</p>

<p>"I saw in this little speech something that
opened to me, as I thought, one side of her
character. All the notice of it, however,
which I took, was to say, 'We must not exact
too much from each other. A person
may have a very single-hearted and sincere
desire to serve us, and yet be somewhat awkward
in conferring benefits. We must not
be unreasonable. Where people do their best
to be kind, we must accept the will for the
deed, and besides....'</p>

<p>"'You mean to say that benefits may be
<i>accepted</i> ungraciously,'&mdash;and she laid her hand
upon mine, and pressed it with some fervor.
Yes, that is true. We may, in the pride of
our unsubdued and unregulated hearts, be
captious, exacting and unjust. We may be
very, very ungrateful.'</p>

<p>"Do I tire you with relating these things?"
said the lady, breaking off, and addressing the
fallen man. "Shall I pass on to others? Yet
there are few events to relate. The history
of this life of a few months is comprised in
conversations. I thought you would probably
like to hear them.</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> like to hear them. I adjure you, solemnly,
to omit nothing that you can remember
of them. She was a noble creature."
And he burst forth with a bitter cry.</p>

<p>"She <i>was</i> a noble creature!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</a></span></p>

<p>"I sat with her some time that day, and
learned some little of her history; but she
was very reserved as to details and explanations.
She told me that she had once lived
in great affluence; but that a sudden reverse
of fortune had ruined her father, who had
been obliged to quit the country; and that
she and her sister had found it necessary immediately
to set about getting their own livelihood.
Only one course was open to either
of them&mdash;that of becoming governesses in
private families, or teachers at schools. They
had wished to adopt the latter course, which
would have enabled them to keep together,
but had not been able to provide themselves
with situations; so they had been compelled
to separate.</p>

<p>"'My sister,' she said, 'took a situation in
London; I was obliged to accept one that
offered in a distant county, so that we were
entirely parted; but in such cases one cannot
choose. My dear Clementina's accomplishments
were such as the family in London
wanted; mine suited those who offered me
the place in the country, or I would have
exchanged with her. But it was not to be.
Things in this miserable world are strangely
ordered.'</p>

<p>"'For the <i>best</i>,' I said, 'when the issues
are known.'</p>

<p>"'Who shall assure us of that? and when
are their issues known?' she asked, with some
bitterness. 'It would need great faith when
one receives a heavy injury, to believe it was
fraught with good, and well intended.'</p>

<p>"'It would, indeed! Yet, we must have
that faith. We ought to have that faith in
Him, the All-wise, Merciful, and Good. We
should have it,&mdash;should we not?&mdash;whatever
appearances might be, in an earthly friend of
this description.'</p>

<p>"'Ah! but we see and know such a friend.'</p>

<p>"'We ought to <i>know</i>, though we cannot
see, that other friend.'</p>

<p>"'Ah! well&mdash;it is so, I dare say. But,
oh, there are moments in life when the cruel
blow is so real, and the consolation so illusory!'</p>

<p>"'Seems so real&mdash;seems so illusory! Ah!
my dear young lady, have you drank so deep
of the cup of sorrow? And have you not
found the great, the only true reality, at the
bottom?'</p>

<p>"She had loosed her hold of my hand, and
turned her head coldly away, as I uttered the
last speech.</p>

<p>"I asked her why she did so.</p>

<p>"'Because you talk like all the rest. At
ease yourselves, religious faith is an easy matter
to you. It is easy to give these every-day
religious consolations, when we have
nothing else to give. But they are things of
a peculiar character. If the soul does not
put them within itself, none upon earth can
bestow them. They are only given of God;
and it has not pleased Him to give them to
me. No,' she went on, with much emotion.
'If there be light in darkness, it shines not
for me. If out of the depths they call, and
He listens, He has not listened to me. My
prayers have been vain, and I have wearied
myself with offering them. There was no
help in them.'</p>

<p>"I was grieved and shocked to hear her
speak thus. I, however, ventured to urge my
point a little further.</p>

<p>"'But you did find help, somewhere?'</p>

<p>"'Not such as I wanted; not health and
strength to my poor darkened spirit.'</p>

<p>"'And why? Because they sought it not
in faith ...'</p>

<p>"'Ah! faith! but who can command this
faith?'</p>

<p>"'Everybody.'</p>

<p>"'Everybody! If it has pleased God to
darken our understandings so that we do not
know him at all, it may be as you say. But
if we know him&mdash;not to trust in him&mdash;<i>that</i>
worst of faith must be our own fault.'</p>

<p>"She was silent, and seemed to sink into a
reverie, which I would not disturb. At last
she shook it off, and turning suddenly to me,
said, 'Clementina had got nearer this truth
than I had, or have. Yes, that it was&mdash;that
it must have been&mdash;which supported her in
circumstances far worse than mine. She was
patient, composed, resigned, and, in spite of
her natural feebleness, showed a strength
which I ever wanted. She endured better
than I do, when she lay low as I do now, and
suffered worse, far worse. How was it?'</p>

<p>"'My strength is made perfect in weakness'&mdash;'Is
not that said?'</p>

<p>"Again she fixed her eyes with a searching,
earnest expression upon mine.</p>

<p>"'But, tell me,' I continued, 'how it fared
with you? I fear badly.'</p>

<p>"'Perhaps you are not aware, Madam, how
much strength, both of body and spirit, it requires
to make a governess.'</p>

<p>"'I think I am aware of it, in good measure.'</p>

<p>"'There seems nothing very onerous in the
task of teaching children during a certain
number of hours every day, and living with
them during the rest. But those who have
tried it alone know how irksome, how exhausting
is the wearisome routine of ungrateful
labor. My situation was tiresome enough.
They were a family of high-spirited children,
as wild as the hills in which they had been
bred, and whose greatest pleasure was to torment
their young governess; though I was
rather excited than depressed by our frequent
struggles for mastery. Then the mother, when
she did interfere, was sensible and just; and
she supported me when she thought me right,
through every thing. If she disapproved, too,
I could be hot and unreasonable in my turn,
and she gently told me of my fault in private,
so as to never impair my authority. She was
a wise and excellent woman. A good mother,
and a true friend, even to her governess.
But it was different with Clementina. Shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>
up in London, with a family of cold-hearted,
proud children, already spoiled by the world,
and never finding it possible to satisfy an
exacting mother, do what she would, the
task was soon too hard for her. The more
languid her health and spirits became, the
feebler her voice, the paler her cheek, the
greater was the dissatisfaction of the lady
whom she served. When the family doctor
was at last called in, he pronounced her to
be in so critical a state of health, that rest
and change of air were indispensable. So
she left, with fifteen pounds&mdash;a half-year's
salary.</p>

<p>"'Consumption had set in when I saw her.
What was to become of her? We knew of
no such place as this, then.</p>

<p>"'The lady whom I served was kind and
considerate. When I came to her in tears, she
bade me fly to my sister, and not return until
I had settled her somewhere in comfort. But
where was that to be? We had not a friend
in the world except one. She had been our
under nursery-maid. She was now a baker's
wife; but she had always loved us. She had
such a heart! And she did not fail us now.</p>

<p>"'She took my sister home, and insisted
upon keeping her. We could not allow this
to be done without offering what compensation
we could. My sister's little purse was
reserved for extraordinary expenses; and I
contrived out of my own salary to pay a little
weekly stipend to our good Matty. She
would not have taken it; but she had a husband,
and upon this point we were resolved.'</p>

<p>"Here she paused, and raising her head
from her pillow, rested it upon her hand, and
looked round the room with an expression of
satisfaction which it gave me great pleasure to
see. The little apartment was plainly furnished
enough; but the walls were of a cheerful
color, and the whole furniture was scrupulously
clean. The windows stood open, looking
upon a space in which a few green trees were
growing. The scene was more open, airy, and
quiet than one can usually obtain in London.
The air came in fresh and pleasant; the green
trees waved and bowed their heads lovingly
and soothingly.</p>

<p>"'It is not until we are sick that we know
the value, that we feel the necessity, of these
things,' she began again. 'This I may venture
to say for us both. We had been cradled
in luxury and elegancies, surrounded by every
thing that the most lavish expenditure could
bestow. We gave them all up without a sigh.
So much unhappiness had attended this unblest
profusion, that it seemed almost a relief&mdash;something
like an emancipation&mdash;to have
done with it, and be restored at once to simplicity
and nature. Whilst our health and
spirits lasted, we both of us took a pleasure
in defying superfluity, in being easy and content
upon a pallet bed, and with a crust of
bread and a glass of water; but, oh! when
sickness comes&mdash;deadly sickness! The fever,
and the languor, and, above all, the frightful
susceptibility to external influences. When
upon the hard bed you cannot sleep, though
sleep is life to the exhausted frame. When
the coarse food you cannot touch&mdash;though
your body is sinking for want of nourishment&mdash;when
the aching limbs get sore with the
rugged unyieldingness of that on which they
lie&mdash;when you languish and sicken for fresh
air, and are shut up in a little close room in
some back street&mdash;when you want medicine
and care, and can command no services at all&mdash;or
of the lowest and most inefficient description&mdash;then&mdash;O
then! we feel what it is to
want&mdash;then we feel what it is to have such
an asylum prepared for us as this. Poor
thing! she was not so fortunate as I have
been.'"</p>

<p>Here, the broken man who had until now
sat listening in what might almost be called
a sullen attention, suddenly lifted up his head,
looked round the room where he sat, and
through the large cheerful window upon the
branches of the trees and the blue unclouded
sky; and, suddenly, even his heart seemed
reached.</p>

<p>He rose from his chair, he sat down again,
he looked conscious, uneasy, abashed. It was
so long since he had felt or expressed any
grateful or amiable sentiment, that he was
almost ashamed of what he now experienced,
as if it had been a weakness.</p>

<p>"Pray have the kindness to go on," he said
at last.</p>

<p>"It was some days before I learned much
more of the history of my poor young invalid,
but one day when I came to see her, I
found a very respectable looking woman,
though evidently not belonging to the higher
class, sitting with her. She was a person
whose appearance would have been almost
repulsive from the deep injuries her face had
received&mdash;burned when a child, I believe&mdash;if
it had not been for the sense and goodness
that pervaded her expression. Her eyes were
singularly intelligent, sweet, and kind.</p>

<p>"I found she was the wife of the baker&mdash;she,
who had once been nursery-maid in your
family. The only friend the poor young creature
seemed to have left in the world, and the
only person from whom she could bear, as it
afterwards appeared, to receive an obligation.
This excellent person it was, who advanced
the guinea a-week, which the laws of the institution
required should be contributed by a
patient.</p>

<p>"When she took her leave I followed her,
to inquire further particulars about my patient.
She then told me, that the sister had
died about three years before, leaving a heavy
debt to be discharged by the one remaining;
consisting of her funeral expenses, which
were considerable, though every thing was
conducted with all the simplicity compatible
with decency; and of the charges of the medical
man who had attended her: a low unprincipled
person, who had sent in an enormous
bill, which there were no means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</a></span>
checking, and which, nevertheless, the high-spirited
sister resolved to pay. But the first
thing she did, was to insure her own life for
a certain sum, so as to guard against the burden
under which she herself labored, being
in its turn imposed upon others.</p>

<p>"'So, madam,' said the good Mrs. Lacy,
with simplicity, 'you must not think that
the guinea a-week is any thing more than an
advance on our part&mdash;there will be money
enough to repay us&mdash;or my dear Miss Ella
would never, never have taken it. She would
die in the street first, she has such a noble
spirit of her own. She told me to provide
for her sister's debts,&mdash;she had made an arrangement
with a publisher to be a regular
contributor to a certain periodical,&mdash;she had
likewise produced a few rather popular novels.
To effect this she had indeed labored
night and day,&mdash;the day with her pupils, half
the night with her pen. She was strong, but
human nature could not support this long;
and yet labor as she did, she proceeded slowly
in clearing away the debt. I cannot quite
account for that,' said Mrs. Lacy, 'she dressed
plainly, she allowed herself no expense,
she made no savings, she paid the debt very
slowly by small instalments, yet she worked
herself into a decline. There seemed to be
some hidden, insatiable call for money....'"</p>

<p>If the lady who was recounting all this,
had looked at her listener at that moment,
she would have been moved, little as she
liked him. A wild horror took possession of
his countenance&mdash;his lips became livid&mdash;his
cheek ghastly&mdash;he muttered a few inarticulate
words between his teeth. But she was
occupied with her own reflections, and noticed
him not.</p>

<p>"This could not go on for ever," said the
lady, presently. "She was obliged to throw
up her situation; soon afterwards the possibility
of writing left her; and she was brought
here, where I found her."</p>

<p>"And that it was&mdash;that it was, then!"
cried the wretched man. 'O Ella, my child!&mdash;my
child! I was living, in indolence and
indifference, upon her hard-earned labors!
I was eating into her life! And when the
supply ceased, I&mdash;I never knew what it was
to have a heart!&mdash;I thought she was tired of
ministering to her father's wants, and I came
to England to upbraid her!"</p>

<p>"It was too late. She was gone where
the wicked cease from troubling, and where
the weary are at rest," said the lady.</p>

<p>"You need not&mdash;you need not&mdash;my heart
is hard, but the dagger has pierced it at last.
You need not drive in the steel: it has done
its work," he rather gasped than said.</p>

<p>The lady felt that she had been too severe.
His apparent insensibility had, it is true,
irritated her almost beyond bearing, after all
he had done, and after all that had been
suffered for his sake.</p>

<p>"I am sorry if I give you pain. I ought
to be sorry for you, not angry."</p>

<p>"Did she never mention me?" he asked,
in a tone of agony. "And there was another,
on whom her young heart doted, only too
fondly. Did she never speak of either of us?"</p>

<p>"She spoke of both."</p>

<p>"Tell me what she said."</p>

<p>The lady hesitated.</p>

<p>"I pray tell me&mdash;I can bear it."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have given you too much
pain already. It is over now. Let it be over.
Go home; and may God give you grace at
the eleventh hour, and bring you and yours
together again at last!" she said fervently,
and the tears starting in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I have no home but one; and to that I
shall shortly go. But let me not depart tormented
with a yearning desire to hear all.
Tell me; I ask it of you as a favor. What
was her state of mind as regarded her mother&mdash;her
father&mdash;and her lover?"</p>

<p>"God gave her grace to find him at last.
The darkness and the doubts that had distressed
her, gradually disappeared. That
grace took possession of her heart which the
world can neither give nor understand; and
all was hope and tranquillity at the last
hour.</p>

<p>"As she grew worse, her spirit became
more and more composed. She told me so
one day. Then she asked me whether I
thought she could recover.</p>

<p>"I was silent.</p>

<p>"She turned pale. Her lips moved as she
said, 'Do I understand your silence rightly?'</p>

<p>"'I am afraid you do.'</p>

<p>"She was silent herself for a short time;
then she said,</p>

<p>"'And so young!'</p>

<p>"'It is not for us to know the times and
seasons which the Father hath kept in his
own power,' said I.</p>

<p>"'But must I&mdash;must I die? I am not
ashamed to own it,&mdash;I did so wish to live.
Did you never hear that I had a father
living?' she asked in so low a voice, that it
was almost a whisper.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I answered.</p>

<p>"'Then, you have heard his most unhappy
history?'</p>

<p>"'Most of it, I believe, I have.'</p>

<p>"'He seems to you, I fear, a very&mdash;very
erring man.'</p>

<p>"I was silent.</p>

<p>"'There is good in him still,' she cried;
'believe it or not who may, there is good in
him still.'</p>

<p>"And now her tears began to flow fast, as
she went on,</p>

<p>"'The will of God be done! The will of
God be done! But if it had been His pleasure,
I hoped to have lived! to have had that
father home; to have joined our two desolate
hearts together; to have brought him to the
knowledge of One whose yoke is easy, and
whose burden is light. O, was that wish
wrong, that it was not granted! O, my father!
who shall seek you out now!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Remember,' I said, gently, 'we are in
the hands of One, wiser and more merciful
than ourselves. He would spare, surely, where
we would spare, if it were good it should be
so. If means would avail, He would provide
the means. His work will not stand still because
the instruments (as we regard things)
seem taken away. Your death, dear girl,
may do more for your father's soul than your
life could ever have done.'"</p>

<p>And now, he bowed his head&mdash;humbly&mdash;and
he covered his face with his hands, and
the tears ran through his fingers.</p>

<p>"Thus," the lady went on, "I comforted
her, as I could; and she died: with her last
breath commending her father to the mercy
of God.</p>

<p>"Her lover was dear&mdash;but not dearer than
her father. She told me that history one day.
How she had loved; how devotedly, how
passionately. But that when her name was
disgraced, she had resolved never to unite it
with his. She had withdrawn herself; she
had done it in a way such as she believed
would displease him. 'I thought he would
feel it less if he were angry,' she said. 'I
often wished in my desolation <i>I</i> could feel
angry.' She told me his name; and I promised
to make inquiries. I had fortunately
the opportunity. I had the pleasure to tell
her, that he had made the greatest efforts to
find her out, but in vain; that he had remained
unmarried and constant to her memory:
that what had happened had given a new
turn to his character. Habits of dissipation,
which had been gradually acquiring power
over him, had been entirely broken through.
He had accepted an office in a distant colony,
where he was leading a most useful and meritorious
life. Never shall I forget the glow of
joy that illuminated her face when I told her
so. She looked already as if she had entered
into the higher and more glorious existence!</p>

<p>"'I shall not see him again,' said she; 'but
you will write to him and tell him all. You
will say that I died true and blest, because he
was what he was; and that I bade him a fond
adieu, until we should meet again in a better
world. For, O! we shall meet again; I have
a testimony within, which shall not deceive
me!'</p>

<p>"She then reverted to her father.</p>

<p>"'He will come back,' she said; 'you will
see that he will come back, and he will inquire
what is become of me&mdash;why his child
has forgotten him and is silent. It will be
the silence and forgetfulness of the grave.
Perhaps he will come back as he went; his
heart yet unchanged: defying and despairing.
Tell him <i>not</i>&mdash;be patient, with him, good kind
friend, for my sake. There is good in him:&mdash;good
he knows not of, himself; that nobody
knows of, but his loving child, and the God
who made him&mdash;weak and erring as he is.
Tell him, he must no more be weak and erring;
tell him there is forgiveness for all who
will return at last, but that forgiveness supposes
newness of life. Tell him&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was unfinished by the lady,
for he who listened fell prostrate on his face
upon the floor.</p>

<p>They raised him up; but his heart seemed
broken. He neither moved nor spoke. Life,
however, was not extinct; for in this condition
he remained many days.</p>

<p>They could not keep him where he was,
for this benevolent institution was strictly
devoted to women of the more refined orders.
He was carried to a Hospital. There was nowhere
else to carry him.</p>

<p>Seven days he lay without speaking; but
not absolutely senseless. The spirit within
him was at work. In his worst days he had
never wanted energy. His heart was ever
strong for good or for bad. What passed
within him, in those seven days, was between
his soul and the Highest. He came out of his
death-trance an altered creature.</p>

<p>The once handsome, dashing, profane, luxurious
Julian Winstanley, looked now a very
old, old man. Quite gray, very thin, and
stooping much. From that time, he continued
to earn his bread honestly, as an attendant
in the very hospital where he had been recovered.
He had a little room to himself,
and it was filled with certain simple treasures,
hallowed by his recollections.</p>

<p>His patient and tender attendance upon the
sick, his assiduous discharge of all his duties,
was beyond praise.</p>

<p>One day, a man who had risen to a very
high post in one of our colonies, came to visit
him. The two were long together. When,
they parted, it was evident that both had
wept much.</p>

<p>The old man, after that, faded rapidly. One
morning they found him dead in bed. His
hands were clasped together, as if he had departed
in the act of prayer. He lies buried
in a neighboring churchyard, under a simple
mound of earth, such as covers the humblest
and the poorest.</p>

<p>He had left behind him a scrap of paper,
earnestly imploring that so it might be. So
it was. May God forgive us all!</p>

<p class="center">BY SIR EDWARD BULWER LYTTON.</p>


<h3>BOOK VIII.&mdash;INITIAL CHAPTER.&mdash;THE ABUSE OF
INTELLECT.</h3>

<p>There is at present so vehement a flourish
of trumpets, and so prodigious a roll of
the drum, whenever we are called upon to
throw up our hats, and cry "Huzza" to the
"March of Enlightenment," that, out of that
very spirit of contradiction natural to all rational
animals, one is tempted to stop one's
ears, and say, "Gently, gently; <span class="smcap">light</span> is
noiseless; how comes 'Enlightenment' to
make such a clatter? Meanwhile if it be not
impertinent, pray, where is enlightenment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</a></span>marching to?" Ask that question of any six
of the loudest bawlers in the procession, and
I'll wager ten-pence to California that you
get six very unsatisfactory answers. One respectable
gentleman, who, to our great astonishment,
insists upon calling himself a
"slave," but has a remarkably free way of
expressing his opinions, will reply&mdash;"Enlightenment
is marching towards the nine points
of the Charter." Another with his hair <i>&agrave; la
jeune France</i>, who has taken a fancy to his
friend's wife, and is rather embarrassed with
his own, asserts that Enlightenment is proceeding
towards the Rights of Women, the
reign of Social Love, and the annihilation
of Tyrannical Prejudice. A third, who
has the air of a man well to do in the middle
class, more modest in his hopes, because he
neither wishes to have his head broken by
his errand-boy, nor his wife carried off to an
Agapemone by his apprentice, does not take
Enlightenment a step farther than a siege on
Debrett, and a cannonade on the Budget. Illiberal
man! the march that he swells will soon
trample <i>him</i> under foot. No one fares so ill
in a crowd, as the man who is wedged in the
middle. A fourth, looking wild and dreamy,
as if he had come out of the cave of Trophonius,
and who is a mesmerizer and a mystic,
thinks Enlightenment is in full career towards
the good old days of alchemists and
necromancers. A fifth, whom one might
take for a Quaker, asserts that the march of
Enlightenment is a crusade for universal philanthropy,
vegetable diet, and the perpetuation
of peace, by means of speeches, which
certainly do produce a very contrary effect
from the Philippics of Demosthenes! The
sixth&mdash;(good fellow, without a rag on his
back)&mdash;does not care a straw where the
march goes. He can't be worse off than he
is; and it is quite immaterial to him whether
he goes to the dog-star above, or the bottomless
pit below. I say nothing, however,
against the march, while we take it altogether.
Whatever happens, one is in good company;
and though I am somewhat indolent
by nature, and would rather stay at home
with Locke and Burke, (dull dogs though they
were,) than have my thoughts set off helter-skelter
with those cursed trumpets and
drums, blown and dub-a-dubbed by fellows
that I vow to heaven I would not trust with
a five-pound note&mdash;still, if I must march, I
must; and so deuce take the hindmost. But
when it comes to individual marchers upon
their own account&mdash;privateers and condottieri
of Enlightenment&mdash;who have filled their
pockets with lucifer-matches, and have a sublime
contempt for their neighbours' barns and
hay-ricks, I don't see why I should throw
myself into the seventh heaven of admiration
and ecstasy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Continued from page 550.</p></div>

<p>If those who are eternally rhapsodizing on
the celestial blessings that are to follow Enlightenment,
Universal Knowledge, and so
forth, would just take their eyes out of their
pockets, and look about them, I would respectfully
inquire if they have never met any
very knowing and enlightened gentleman,
whose acquaintance is by no means desirable.
If not, they are monstrous lucky. Every
man must judge by his own experience; and
the worst rogues I have ever encountered
were amazingly well-informed, clever fellows!
From dunderheads and dunces we can protect
ourselves; but from your sharp-witted
gentleman, all enlightenment and no prejudice,
we have but to cry, "Heaven defend
us!" It is true, that the rogue (let him be
ever so enlightened) usually comes to no
good himself, (though not before he has done
harm enough to his neighbors.) But that only
shows that the world wants something else
in those it rewards, besides intelligence <i>per se</i>
and in the abstract; and is much too old a
world to allow any Jack Horner to pick out
its plums for his own personal gratification.
Hence a man of very moderate intelligence,
who believes in God, suffers his heart to beat
with human sympathies, and keeps his eyes
off your strong-box, will perhaps gain
a vast deal more power than knowledge ever
gives to a rogue.</p>

<p>Wherefore, though I anticipate an outcry
against me on the part of the blockheads,
who, strange to say, are the most credulous
idolaters of enlightenment, and, if knowledge
were power, would rot on a dunghill;
yet, nevertheless, I think all really enlightened
men will agree with me, that when one
falls in with detached sharpshooters from the
general march of enlightenment, it is no
reason to make ourselves a target, because
enlightenment has furnished them with a
gun. It has, doubtless, been already remarked
by the judicious reader, that of the numerous
characters introduced into this work, the larger
portion belong to that species which we
call <span class="smcap">Intellectual</span>&mdash;that through them are
analyzed and developed human intellect, in
various forms and directions. So that this
History, rightly considered, is a kind of humble,
familiar Epic, or, if you prefer it, a long
Serio-Comedy, upon the varieties of English
Life in this our Century, set in movement by
the intelligences most prevalent. And where
more ordinary and less refined types of the
species round and complete the survey of our
passing generation, they will often suggest, by
contrast, the deficiencies which mere intellectual
culture leaves in the human being. Certainly
I have no spite against intellect and enlightenment.
Heaven forbid I should be
such a Goth. I am only the advocate for
common sense and fair play. I don't think
an able man necessarily an angel; but I think
if his heart match his head, and both proceed
in the Great March under the divine Oriflamme,
he goes as near to the angel as humanity
will permit; if not, if he has but a
penn'orth of heart to a pound of brains, I
say, "<i>Bon jour, mon ange?</i> I see not the
starry upward wings, but the grovelling cloven-hoof."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span>
I'd rather be obfuscated by the
Squire of Hazeldean, than enlightened by
Randal Leslie. Every man to his taste. But
intellect itself (not in the philosophical, but the
ordinary sense of the term) is rarely, if ever,
one completed harmonious agency; it is not
one faculty, but a compound of many, some
of which are often at war with each other,
and mar the concord of the whole. Few of
us but have some predominant faculty, in itself
a strength; but which (usurping unseasonably
dominion over the rest) shares the
lot of all tyranny, however brilliant, and
leaves the empire weak against disaffection
within, and invasion from without. Hence intellect
maybe perverted in a man of evil disposition,
and sometimes merely wasted in a
man of excellent impulses, for want of the
necessary discipline, or of a strong ruling motive.
I doubt if there be one person in the
world, who has attained a high reputation
for talent, who has not met somebody much
cleverer than himself, which said somebody
has never obtained any reputation at all!
Men, like Audley Egerton, are constantly
seen in the great positions of life; while
men, like Harley l'Estrange, who could have
beaten them hollow in any thing equally
striven for by both, float away down the
stream, and, unless some sudden stimulant
arouse the dreamy energies, vanish out of
sight into silent graves. If Hamlet and Polonius
were living now, Polonius would have
a much better chance of being Chancellor of
the Exchequer, though Hamlet would unquestionably
be a much more intellectual
character. What would become of Hamlet?
Heaven knows! Dr. Arnold said, from his
experience of a school, that the difference between
one man and another was not mere
ability&mdash;it was energy. There is a great deal
of truth in that saying.</p>

<p>Submitting these hints to the judgment
and penetration of the sagacious, I enter on
the fresh division of this work, and see already
Randal Leslie gnawing his lip on the
back ground. The German poet observes,
that the Cow of Isis is to some the divine
symbol of knowledge, to others but the milch
cow, only regarded for the pounds of butter
she will yield. O tendency of our age, to
look on Isis as the milch cow! O prostitution
of the grandest desires to the basest
uses! Gaze on the goddess, Randal Leslie,
and get ready thy churn and thy scales.
Let us see what the butter will fetch in the
market.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>A new reign has commenced. There has
been a general election; the unpopularity of
the Administration has been apparent at the
hustings. Audley Egerton, hitherto returned
by vast majorities, has barely escaped defeat&mdash;thanks
to a majority of five. The expenses
of his election are said to have been prodigious.
"But who can stand against such
wealth as Egerton's&mdash;no doubt backed, too,
by the Treasury purse?" said the defeated
candidate. It is towards the close of October;
London is already full; Parliament will
meet in less than a fortnight.</p>

<p>In one of the principal apartments of that
hotel in which foreigners may discover what
is meant by English comfort, and the price
which foreigners must pay for it, there sat
two persons, side by side, engaged in close
conversation. The one was a female, in
whose pale clear complexion and raven hair&mdash;in
whose eyes, vivid with a power of expression
rarely bestowed on the beauties of
the north, we recognize Beatrice, Marchesa
di Negra. Undeniably handsome as was the
Italian lady, her companion, though a man,
and far advanced into middle age, was yet
more remarkable for personal advantages.
There was a strong family likeness between
the two; but there was also a striking contrast
in air, manner, and all that stamps on
the physiognomy the idiosyncrasies of character.
There was something of gravity, of earnestness
and passion, in Beatrice's countenance
when carefully examined; her smile
at times might be false, but it was rarely
ironical, never cynical. Her gestures, though
graceful, were unrestrained and frequent.
You could see she was a daughter of the
south. Her companion, on the contrary, preserved
on the fair smooth face, to which years
had given scarcely a line or wrinkle, something
that might have passed, at first glance
for the levity and thoughtlessness of a gay
and youthful nature; but the smile, though
exquisitely polished, took at times the derision
of a sneer. In his manners he was as
composed and as free from gesture as an Englishman.
His hair was of that red brown
with which the Italian painters produce such
marvellous effects of color; and if here and
there a silver thread gleamed through the
locks it was lost at once amidst their luxuriance.
His eyes were light, and his complexion
though without much color, was singularly
transparent. His beauty, indeed, would have
been rather womanly than masculine, but for
the height and sinewy spareness of a frame
in which muscular strength was rather adorned
than concealed by an admirable elegance
of proportion. You would never have guessed
this man to be an Italian; more likely you
would have supposed him a Parisian. He
conversed in French, his dress was of French
fashion, his mode of thought seemed French.
Not that he was like the Frenchmen of the
present day&mdash;an animal, either rude or reserved;
but your ideal of the <i>Marquis</i> of the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>&mdash;the
<i>rou&eacute;</i> of the Regency.</p>

<p>Italian, however, he was, and of a race
renowned in Italian history. But as if
ashamed of his country and his birth, he affected
to be a citizen of the world. Heaven help
the world if it hold only such citizens!</p>

<p>"But, Giulio," said Beatrice di Negra,
speaking in Italian, "even granting that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</a></span>
discover this girl, can you suppose that her
father will ever consent to your alliance?
Surely you know too well the nature of your
kinsman?"</p>

<p>"<i>Tu te trompes, ma s&oelig;ur</i>," replied Giulio
Franzini, Count di Peschiera, in French as
usual&mdash;"<i>tu te trompes</i>; I knew it before he
had gone through exile and penury. How
can I know it now? But comfort yourself,
my too anxious Beatrice, I shall not care
for his consent till I have made sure of his
daughter's."</p>

<p>"But how win that in despite of the
father?"</p>

<p>"<i>Eh, mordieu?</i>" interrupted the Count,
with true French gayety; "what would become
of all the comedies ever written, if marriages
were not made in despite of the father?
Look you," he resumed, with a very slight
compression of his lip, and a still slighter movement
in his chair; "look you, this is no question
of ifs and buts&mdash;it is a question of must
and shall&mdash;a question of existence to you and
to me. When Danton was condemned to the
guillotine, he said, flinging a pellet of bread
at the nose of his respectable judge&mdash;'<i>Mon
individu sera bient&ocirc;t dans le n&eacute;ant</i>'&mdash;My patrimony
is there already! I am loaded with
debts. I see before me, on the one side, ruin
or suicide; on the other side, wedlock and
wealth."</p>

<p>"But from those vast possessions which
you have been permitted to enjoy so long,
have you really saved nothing against the
time when they might be reclaimed at your
hands?"</p>

<p>"My sister," replied the Count, "do I look
like a man who saved? Besides, when the
Austrian Emperor, unwilling to raise from his
Lombard domains a name and a house so illustrious
as our kinsman's, and desirous, while
punishing that kinsman's rebellion, to reward
my adherence, forbore the peremptory confiscation
of those vast possessions at which my
mouth waters while we speak, but, annexing
them to the Crown during pleasure, allowed
me, as the next of male kin, to retain the revenues
of one-half for the same very indefinite
period&mdash;had I not every reason to suppose,
that, before long, I could so influence his
Majesty or his minister, as to obtain a decree
that might transfer the whole, unconditionally
and absolutely, to myself? And methinks
I should have done so, but for this
accursed, intermeddling English Milord, who
has never ceased to besiege the court or the
minister with alleged extenuations of our cousin's
rebellion, and proofless assertions that
I shared it in order to entangle my kinsman,
and betrayed it in order to profit by his spoils.
So that, at last, in return for all my services,
and in answer to all my claims, I received
from the minister himself this cold reply:
'Count of Peschiera, your aid was important,
and your reward has been large. That reward,
it would not be for your honor to extend,
and justify the ill opinion of your Italian
countrymen by formally appropriating to yourself
all that was forfeited by the treason you
denounced. A name so noble as yours should
be dearer to you than fortune itself.'"</p>

<p>"Ah, Giulio," cried Beatrice, her face lighting
up, changed in its whole character; "those
were words that might make the demon that
tempts to avarice fly from your breast in
shame."</p>

<p>The Count opened his eyes in great amaze;
then he glanced round the room and said,
quietly:</p>

<p>"Nobody else hears you, my dear Beatrice,
talk common sense. Heroics sound well in
mixed society; but there is nothing less suited
to the tone of a family conversation."</p>

<p>Madame di Negra bent down her head
abashed, and that sudden change in the expression
of her countenance, which had seemed
to betray susceptibility to generous emotion,
faded as suddenly away.</p>

<p>"But still," she said coldly, "you enjoy
one-half of those ample revenues&mdash;why talk,
then, of suicide and ruin?"</p>

<p>"I enjoy them at the pleasure of the crown;
and what if it be the pleasure of the crown
to recall our cousin, and reinstate him in his
possessions?"</p>

<p>"There is a <i>probability</i>, then, of that pardon?
When you first employed me in your
researches, you only thought there was a
<i>possibility</i>."</p>

<p>"There is a great probability of it, and
therefore I am here. I learned some little
time since that the question of such recall had
been suggested by the Emperor, and discussed
in Council. The danger to the State, which
might arise from our cousin's wealth, his alleged
abilities&mdash;(abilities! bah!)&mdash;and his popular
name, deferred any decision on the point;
and, indeed, the difficulty of dealing with myself
must have embarrassed the ministry. But
it is a mere question of time. He cannot long
remain excluded from the general amnesty,
already extended to the other refugees. The
person who gave me this information is high
in power, and friendly to myself; and he added
a piece of advice, on which I acted. 'It
was intimated,' said he, 'by one of the partisans
of your kinsman, that the exile could
give a hostage for his loyalty in the person of
his daughter and heiress; that she had arrived
at marriageable age; that if she were
to wed, with the Emperor's consent, some
one whose attachment to the Austrian crown
was unquestionable, there would be a guarantee
both for the faith of the father, and for
the transmission of so important a heritage to
safe and loyal hands. Why not' (continued
my friend) 'apply to the Emperor for his consent
to that alliance for yourself?&mdash;you, on
whom he can depend;&mdash;you who, if the
daughter should die, would be the legal heir
to those lands?' On that hint I spoke."</p>

<p>"You saw the Emperor?"</p>

<p>"And after combating the unjust prepossessions
against me, I stated, that so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</a></span>
from my cousin having any fair cause of resentment
against me, when all was duly explained
to him, I did not doubt that he would
willingly give me the hand of his child."</p>

<p>"You did?" cried the Marchesa, amazed.</p>

<p>"And," continued the Count imperturbably,
as he smoothed, with careless hand, the
snowy plaits of his shirt front&mdash;"and that I
should thus have the happiness of becoming
myself the guarantee of my kinsman's loyalty&mdash;the
agent for the restoration of his
honors, while, in the eyes of the envious and
malignant, I should clear up my own name
from all suspicion that I had wronged him."</p>

<p>"And the Emperor consented?"</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu</i>, my dear sister. What else
could his majesty do? My proposition smoothed
every obstacle, and reconciled policy with
mercy. It remains, therefore, only to find
out, what has hitherto baffled all our researches,
the retreat of our dear kinsfolk,
and to make myself a welcome lover to the
demoiselle. There is some disparity of years,
I own; but&mdash;unless your sex and my glass
flatter me overmuch&mdash;I am still a match for
many a gallant of five-and-twenty."</p>

<p>The Count said this with so charming a
smile, and looked so pre-eminently handsome,
that he carried off the coxcombry of the
words as gracefully as if they had been spoken
by some dazzling hero of the grand old
comedy of Parisian life.</p>

<p>Then interlacing his fingers, and lightly
leaning his hands, thus clasped, upon his sister's
shoulder, he looked into her face, and
said slowly&mdash;"And now, my sister, for some
gentle but deserved reproach. Have you not
sadly failed me in the task I imposed on your
regard for my interests? Is it not some
years since you first came to England on the
mission of discovering these worthy relatives
of ours? Did I not entreat you to seduce
into your toils the man whom I knew to be
my enemy, and was indubitably acquainted
with our cousin's retreat&mdash;a secret he has
hitherto locked within his bosom? Did you
not tell me, that though he was then in England,
you could find no occasion even to meet
him, but that you had obtained the friendship
of the statesman to whom I directed
your attention, as his most intimate associate?
And yet you, whose charms are usually so irresistible,
learn nothing from the statesman, as
you see nothing of <i>Milord</i>. Nay, baffled and
misled, you actually supposed that the quarry
has taken refuge in France. You go
thither&mdash;you pretend to search the capital&mdash;the
provinces, Switzerland, <i>que sais-je</i>?&mdash;all
in vain,&mdash;though&mdash;<i>foi de gentilhomme</i>&mdash;your
police cost me dearly,&mdash;you return to England&mdash;the
same chase, and the same result.
<i>Palsambleu, ma s&oelig;ur</i>, I do too much credit to
your talents not to question your zeal. In
a word have you been in earnest&mdash;or have
you not had some womanly pleasure in amusing
yourself and abusing my trust?"</p>

<p>"Giulio," answered Beatrice sadly, "you
know the influence you have exercised over
my character and my fate. Your reproaches
are not just. I made such inquiries as were
in my power, and I have now cause to believe
that I know one who is possessed of this
secret, and can guide us to it."</p>

<p>"Ah, you do!" exclaimed the Count. Beatrice
did not heed the exclamation, but hurried
on.</p>

<p>"But grant that my heart shrunk from the
task you imposed on me, would it not have
been natural? When I first came to England,
you informed me that your object in
discovering the exiles was one which I could
honestly aid. You naturally desired first to
know if the daughter lived; if not, you were
the heir. If she did, you assured me you desired
to effect, through my mediation, some
liberal compromise with Alphonso, by which
you would have sought to obtain his restoration,
provided he would leave you for life in
possession of the grant you hold from the
crown. While these were your objects, I
did my best, ineffectual as it was, to obtain
the information required."</p>

<p>"And what made me lose so important
though so ineffectual an ally?" asked the
Count, still smiling; but a gleam that belied
the smile shot from his eye.</p>

<p>"What! when you bade me receive and
co-operate with the miserable spies&mdash;the false
Italians&mdash;whom you sent over, and seek to
entangle this poor exile, when found in some
rash correspondence, to be revealed to the
court; when you sought to seduce the daughter
of the Count of Peschiera, the descendant
of those who had ruled in Italy, into the informer,
the corrupter, and the traitress! No,
Giulio&mdash;then I recoiled; and then, fearful of
your own sway over me, I retreated into
France. I have answered you frankly."</p>

<p>The Count removed his hands from the
shoulders on which they had reclined so cordially.</p>

<p>"And this," said he, "is your wisdom, and
this your gratitude. You, whose fortunes
are bound up in mine&mdash;you, who subsist on
my bounty&mdash;you, who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold," cried the Marchesa, rising, and
with a burst of emotion, as if stung to the
utmost, and breaking into revolt from the
tyranny of years&mdash;"Hold&mdash;gratitude! bounty!
Brother, brother&mdash;what, indeed, do I
owe to you? The shame and the misery of
a life. While yet a child, you condemned
me to marry against my will&mdash;against my
heart&mdash;against my prayers&mdash;and laughed at
my tears when I knelt to you for mercy. I
was pure then, Giulio&mdash;pure and innocent as
the flowers in my virgin crown. And now&mdash;now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Beatrice stopped abruptly, and clasped her
hands before her face.</p>

<p>"Now you upbraid me," said the Count,
unruffled by her sudden passion, "because I
gave you in marriage to a man young and
noble?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span></p>

<p>"Old in vices and mean of soul! The marriage
I forgave you. You had the right, according
to the customs of our country, to dispose
of my hand. But I forgave you not the
consolations that you whispered in the ear
of a wretched and insulted wife."</p>

<p>"Pardon me the remark," replied the Count,
with a courtly bend of his head, "but those
consolations were also conformable to the
customs of our country, and I was not aware
till now that you had wholly disdained them.
And," continued the Count, "you were not so
long a wife that the gall of the chain should
smart still. You were soon left a widow&mdash;free,
childless, young, beautiful."</p>

<p>"And penniless."</p>

<p>"True, Di Negra was a gambler, and very
unlucky; no fault of mine. I could neither
keep the cards from his hands, nor advise him
how to play them."</p>

<p>"And my own portion? Oh, Giulio, I
knew but at his death why you had condemned
me to that renegade Genoese. He
owed you money, and, against honor, and I
believe against law, you had accepted my
fortune in discharge of the debt."</p>

<p>"He had no other way to discharge it&mdash;a
debt of honor must be paid&mdash;old stories these.
"What matters? Since then my purse has
been open to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, not as your sister, but your instrument&mdash;your
spy! Yes, your purse has been
open&mdash;with a niggard hand."</p>

<p>"<i>Un peu de conscience, ma ch&egrave;re</i>, you are
so extravagant. But come, be plain. What
would you?"</p>

<p>"I would be free from you."</p>

<p>"That is, you would form some second
marriage with one of these rich island lords.
<i>Ma foi</i>, I respect your ambition."</p>

<p>"It is not so high. I aim but to escape
from slavery&mdash;to be placed beyond dishonorable
temptation. I desire," cried Beatrice
with increased emotion, "I desire to re-enter
the life of woman."</p>

<p>"Eno'!" said the Count with a visible impatience,
"is there anything in the attainment
of your object that should render you
indifferent to mine? You desire to marry, if
I comprehend you right. And to marry, as
becomes you, you should bring to your husband
not debts, but a dowry. Be it so. I
will restore the portion that I saved from the
spendthrift clutch of the Genoese&mdash;the moment
that it is mine to bestow&mdash;- the moment
that I am husband to my kinsman's heiress.
And now, Beatrice, you imply that my former
notions revolted your conscience; my
present plan should content it; for by this
marriage shall our kinsman regain his country,
and repossess, at least, half his lands.
And if I am not an excellent husband to the
demoiselle, it will be her own fault. I have
sown my wild oats. <i>Je suis bon prince</i>, when
I have things a little my own way. It is my
hope and my intention, and certainly it will
be my interest, to become <i>digne &eacute;poux et
irr&eacute;proachable pire de famille</i>. I speak lightly&mdash;'tis
my way. I mean seriously. The
little girl will be very happy with me, and I
shall succeed in soothing all resentment her
father may retain. Will you aid me then&mdash;yes
or no? Aid me, and you shall indeed be
free. The magician will release the fair spirit
he has bound to his will. Aid me not, <i>ma
ch&egrave;re</i>, and mark, I do not threaten&mdash;I do but
warn&mdash;aid me not; grant that I become a
beggar, and ask yourself what is to become
of you&mdash;still young, still beautiful, and still
penniless? Nay, worse than penniless; you
have done me the honor (and here the Count,
looking on the table, drew a letter from a
portfolio, emblazoned with his arms and coronet),
you have done me the honor to consult
me as to your debts."</p>

<p>"You will restore my fortune?" said the
Marchesa, irresolutely&mdash;and averting her
head from an odious schedule of figures.</p>

<p>"When my own, with your aid, is secured."</p>

<p>"But do you not overrate the value of my
aid?"</p>

<p>"Possibly," said the Count, with a caressing
suavity&mdash;and he kissed his sister's forehead.
"Possibly; but by my honor, I wish
to repair to you any wrong, real or supposed,
I may have done you in past times. I wish
to find again my own dear sister. I may
overvalue your aid, but not the affection from
which it comes. Let us be friends, <i>cara Beatrice
Mia</i>," added the Count, for the first
time employing Italian words.</p>

<p>The Marchesa laid her head on his shoulder,
and her tears flowed softly. Evidently
this man had great influence over her&mdash;and
evidently, whatever her cause for complaint,
her affection for him was still sisterly and
strong. A nature with fine flashes of generosity,
spirit, honor, and passion, was hers&mdash;but
uncultured, unguided&mdash;spoilt by the
worst social examples&mdash;easily led into wrong&mdash;not
always aware where the wrong was&mdash;letting
affections good or bad whisper away
her conscience or blind her reason. Such
women are often far more dangerous when
induced to wrong, than those who are thoroughly
abandoned&mdash;such women are the
accomplices men like the Count of Peschiera
most desire to obtain.</p>

<p>"Ah, Giulio," said Beatrice, after a pause,
and looking up at him through her tears,
"when you speak to me thus, you know you
can do with me what you will. Fatherless
and motherless, whom had my childhood to
love and obey but you?"</p>

<p>"Dear Beatrice," murmured the Count
tenderly&mdash;and he again kissed her forehead.
"So," he continued more carelessly&mdash;"so the
reconciliation is effected, and our interests
and our hearts re-allied. Now, alas! to
descend to business. You say that you know
some one whom you believe to be acquainted
with the lurking-place of my father-in-law&mdash;that
is to be!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think so. You remind me that I have
an appointment with him this day: it is near
the hour&mdash;I must leave you."</p>

<p>"To learn the secret?&mdash;Quick&mdash;quick. I
have no fear of your success, if it is by his
heart that you lead him."</p>

<p>"You mistake; on his heart I have no
hold. But he has a friend who loves me,
and honorably, and whose cause he pleads.
I think here that I have some means to control
or persuade him. If not&mdash;ah, he is of a
character that perplexes me in all but his
worldly ambition; and how can we foreigners
influence him through <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"Is he poor, or is he extravagant?"</p>

<p>"Not extravagant, and not positively poor,
but dependent."</p>

<p>"Then we have him," said the Count composedly.
"If his assistance he worth buying,
we can bid high for it. <i>Sur mon &acirc;me</i>, I never
yet knew money fail with any man who was
both worldly and dependent. I put him and
myself in your hands."</p>

<p>Thus saying, the Count opened the door,
and conducted his sister with formal politeness
to her carriage. He then returned, reseated
himself, and mused in silence. As he
did so, the muscles of his countenance relaxed.
The levity of the Frenchman fled
from his visage, and in his eye, as it gazed
abstractedly into space, there was that steady
depth so remarkable in the old portraits of
Florentine diplomatist or Venetian oligarch.
Thus seen, there was in that face, despite all
its beauty, something that would have awed
back even the fond gaze of love; something
hard, collected, inscrutable, remorseless;
but this change of countenance did not last
long. Evidently thought, though intense for
the moment, was not habitual to the man.
Evidently he had lived the life which takes
all things lightly&mdash;so he rose with a look of
fatigue, shook and stretched himself, as if to
cast off, or grow out of, an unwelcome and
irksome mood. An hour afterwards, the
Count of Peschiera was charming all eyes, and
pleasing all ears, in the saloon of a high-born
beauty, whose acquaintance he had made at
Vienna, and whose charms, according to that
old and never-truth-speaking oracle, Polite
Scandal, were now said to have attracted to
London the brilliant foreigner.</p>

<p>The Marchesa regained her house, which
was in Curzon street, and withdrew to her
own room, to readjust her dress, and remove
from her countenance all traces of the tears
she had shed.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour afterwards she was seated in
her drawing-room, composed and calm; nor,
seeing her then, could you have guessed that
she was capable of so much emotion and so
much weakness. In that stately exterior, in
that quiet attitude, in that elaborate and
finished elegance which comes alike from the
arts of the toilet and the conventional repose
of rank, you could see but the woman of the
world and the great lady.</p>

<p>A knock at the door was heard, and in a
few moments there entered a visitor, with
the easy familiarity of intimate acquaintance&mdash;a
young man, but with none of the bloom
of youth. His hair, fine as a woman's, was
thin and scanty, but it fell low over the forehead,
and concealed that noblest of our human
features. "A gentleman," says Apuleius,
"ought, if he can, to wear his whole mind
on his forehead."<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The young visitor
would never have committed so frank an imprudence.
His cheek was pale, and in his
step and in his movements there was a languor
that spoke of fatigued nerves or delicate
health. But the light of the eye and the tone
of the voice were those of a mental temperament
controlling the bodily&mdash;vigorous and
energetic. For the rest, his general appearance
was distinguished by a refinement
alike intellectual and social. Once seen, you
would not easily forget him. And the reader
no doubt already recognizes Randal Leslie.
His salutation, as I before said, was that of
intimate familiarity; yet it was given and
replied to with that unreserved openness
which denotes the absence of a more tender
sentiment.</p>

loses much by translation:&mdash;"Hominem liberum et magnificum
debere, si queat, in primori fronte, animum gestare."</p></div>

<p>Seating himself by the Marchesa's side,
Randal began first to converse on the fashionable
topics and gossip of the day; but it was
observable, that, while he extracted from her
the current anecdote and scandal of the great
world, neither anecdote nor scandal did he
communicate in return. Randal Leslie had
already learned the art not to commit himself,
nor to have quoted against him one ill-natured
remark upon the eminent. Nothing
more injures the man who would rise beyond
the fame of the <i>salons</i>, than to be considered
backbiter and gossip; "yet it is always useful,"
thought Randal Leslie, "to know the foibles&mdash;the
small social and private springs by
which the great are moved. Critical occasions
may arise in which such knowledge
may be power." And hence, perhaps, (besides
a more private motive, soon to be perceived,)
Randal did not consider his time
thrown away in cultivating Madame di Negra's
friendship. For despite much that was
whispered against her, she had succeeded in
dispelling the coldness with which she had
at first been received in the London circles.
Her beauty, her grace, and her high birth,
had raised her into fashion, and the homage
of men of the first station, while it perhaps
injured her reputation as a woman, added to
her celebrity as fine lady. So much do we
cold English, prudes though we be, forgive to
the foreigner what we avenge on the native.</p>

<p>Sliding at last from these general topics
into very well-bred and elegant personal compliment,
and reciting various eulogies, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span>Lord this and the Duke of that had passed
on the Marchesa's charms, Randal laid his
hand on hers, with the license of admitted
friendship, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"But since you have deigned to confide in
me, since when (happily for me, and with a
generosity which no coquette could have been
capable) you, in good time, repressed into
friendship feelings that might else have ripened
into those you are formed to inspire and disdain
to return, you told me with your charming
smile, 'Let no one speak to me of love who
does not offer me his hand, and with it the
means to supply tastes that I fear are terribly
extravagant;'&mdash;since thus you allowed me to
divine your natural objects, and upon that
understanding our intimacy has been founded,
you will pardon me for saying that the admiration
you excite amongst the <i>grands seigneurs</i>
I have named, only serves to defeat your own
purpose, and scare away admirers less brilliant,
but more in earnest. Most of these
gentlemen are unfortunately married; and
they who are not belong to those members
of our aristocracy who, in marriage, seek
more than beauty and wit&mdash;namely, connections
to strengthen their political station, or
wealth to redeem a mortgage and sustain a
title."</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Leslie," replied the Marchesa&mdash;and
a certain sadness might be detected
in the tone of the voice and the droop
of the eye&mdash;"I have lived long enough in the
real world to appreciate the baseness and the
falsehood of most of those sentiments which
take the noblest names. I see through the
hearts of the admirers you parade before me,
and know that not one of them would shelter
with his ermine the woman to whom he
talks of his heart. Ah," continued Beatrice,
with a softness of which she was unconscious,
but which might have been extremely dangerous
to youth less steeled and self-guarded
than was Randal Leslie's&mdash;"ah, I am less
ambitious than you suppose. I have dreamed
of a friend, a companion, a protector, with
feelings still fresh, undebased by the low
round of vulgar dissipation and mean pleasures&mdash;of
a heart so new, that it might restore
my own to what it was in its happy
spring. I have seen in your country some
marriages, the mere contemplation of which
has filled my eyes with delicious tears. I
have learned in England to know the value
of home. And with such a heart as I describe,
and such a home, I could forget that
I ever knew a less pure ambition."</p>

<p>"This language does not surprise me,"
said Randal; "yet it does not harmonize
with your former answer to me."</p>

<p>"To you," repeated Beatrice smiling, and
regaining her lighter manner; "to you&mdash;true.
But I never had the vanity to think that
your affection for me could bear the sacrifices
it would cost you in marriage; that
you, with your ambition, could bound your
dreams of happiness to home. And then,
too," said she, raising her head, and with
a certain grave pride in her air&mdash;"and <i>then</i>,
I could not have consented to share my fate
with one whom my poverty would cripple.
I could not listen to my heart, if it had beat
for a lover without fortune, for to him I
could then have brought but a burden, and
betrayed him into a union with poverty and
debt. Now it may be different. Now I may
have the dowry that befits my birth. And
now I may be free to choose according to my
heart as woman, not according to my necessities,
as one poor, harassed, and despairing."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Randal, interested and drawing
still closer towards his fair companion&mdash;"ah,
I congratulate you sincerely; you have
cause, then, to think that you shall be&mdash;rich?"</p>

<p>The Marchesa paused before she answered,
and during that pause Randal relaxed the
web of the scheme which he had been secretly
weaving, and rapidly considered whether, if
Beatrice di Negra would indeed be rich, she
might answer to himself as a wife; and in
what way, if so, he had best change his tone
from that of friendship into that of love.
While thus reflecting, Beatrice answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not rich for an Englishwoman; for an
Italian, yes. My fortune should be half a
million&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Half a million!" cried Randal, and with
difficulty he restrained himself from falling
at her feet in adoration.</p>

<p>"Of francs!" continued the Marchesa.</p>

<p>"Francs! Ah," said Randal, with a long-drawn
breath, and recovering from his sudden
enthusiasm, "about twenty thousand
pounds!&mdash;eight hundred a-year at four per
cent. A very handsome portion, certainly&mdash;(Genteel
poverty! he murmured to himself.
What an escape I have had! but I see&mdash;I see.
This will smooth all difficulties in the way of
my better and earlier project. I see)&mdash;a very
handsome portion," he repeated aloud&mdash;"not
for a <i>grand seigneur</i>, indeed, but still for a
gentleman of birth and expectations worthy
of your choice, if ambition be not your first
object. Ah, while you spoke with such endearing
eloquence of feelings that were fresh,
of a heart that was new, of the happy English
home, you might guess that my thoughts
ran to my friend who loves you so devotedly,
and who so realizes your ideal. Providentially,
with us, happy marriages and happy
homes are found not in the gay circles of
London fashion, but at the hearths of our rural
nobility&mdash;our untitled country gentlemen.
And who, amongst all your adorers, can
offer you a lot so really enviable as the one
whom, I see by your blush, you already guess
that I refer to?"</p>

<p>"Did I blush?" said the Marchesa, with a
silvery laugh. "Nay, I think that your zeal
for your friend misled you. But I will own
frankly, I have been touched by his honest
ingenuous love&mdash;so evident, yet rather looked
than spoken. I have contrasted the love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</a></span>
that honors me with the suitors that seek
to degrade; more I cannot say. For though
I grant that your friend is handsome, high-spirited,
and generous, still he is not what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mistake, believe me," interrupted
Randal. "You shall not finish your sentence.
He is all that you do not yet suppose him;
for his shyness, and his very love, his very
respect for your superiority, do not allow his
mind and his nature to appear to advantage.
You, it is true, have a taste for letters and
poetry rare among your countrywomen.
He has not at present&mdash;few men have. But
what Cimon would not be refined by so
fair an Iphigenia? Such frivolities as he now
shows belong but to youth and inexperience
of life. Happy the brother who could see
his sister the wife of Frank Hazeldean."</p>

<p>The Marchesa leant her cheek on her hand
in silence. To her, marriage was more than
it usually seems to dreaming maiden or to
disconsolate widow. So had the strong desire
to escape from the control of her unprincipled
and remorseless brother grown a part of
her very soul&mdash;so had whatever was best
and highest in her very mixed and complex
character been galled and outraged by her
friendless and exposed position, the equivocal
worship rendered to her beauty, the various
debasements to which pecuniary embarrassments
had subjected her&mdash;(not without design
on the part of the count, who, though
grasping, was not miserly, and who by precarious
and seemingly capricious gifts at one
time, and refusals of all aid at another, had
involved her in debt in order to retain his
hold on her)&mdash;so utterly painful and humiliating
to a woman of her pride and her birth
was the station that she held in the world&mdash;that
in marriage she saw liberty, life, honor,
self-redemption; and these thoughts,
while they compelled her to co-operate with
the schemes, by which the count, on securing
to himself a bride, was to bestow on herself
a dower, also disposed her now to receive
with favour Randal Leslie's pleadings on behalf
of his friend.</p>

<p>The advocate saw that he had made an
impression, and with the marvellous skill
which his knowledge of those natures that
engaged his study bestowed on his intelligence,
he continued to improve his cause by
such representations as were likely to be
most effective. With what admirable tact
he avoided panegyric of Frank as the mere
individual, and drew him rather as the type,
the ideal of what a woman in Beatrice's position
might desire, in the safety, peace, and
honor of a home, in the trust, and constancy,
and honest confiding love of its partner!
He did not paint an Elysium; he described a
haven; he did not glowingly delineate a hero
of romance&mdash;he soberly portrayed that Representative
of the Respectable and the Real
which a woman turns to when romance begins
to seem to her but delusion. Verily, if
you could have looked into the heart of the
person he addressed, and heard him speak,
you would have cried admiringly, "Knowledge
<i>is</i> power; and this man, if as able on a
larger field of action, should play no mean
part in the history of his time."</p>

<p>Slowly Beatrice roused herself from the
reveries which crept over her as he spoke&mdash;slowly,
and with a deep sigh, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, well, grant all you say; at least
before I can listen to so honorable a love, I
must be relieved from the base and sordid
pressure that weighs on me. I cannot say
to the man who woos me, 'Will you pay
the debts of the daughter of Franzini, and
the widow of di Negra?'"</p>

<p>"Nay, your debts, surely, make so slight a
portion of your dowry."</p>

<p>"But the dowry has to be secured;" and
here, turning the tables upon her companion,
as the apt proverb expresses it, Madame di
Negra extended her hand to Randal, and said
in her most winning accents, "You are, then,
truly and sincerely my friend?"</p>

<p>"Can you doubt it?"</p>

<p>"I prove that I do not, for I ask your assistance."</p>

<p>"Mine? How?"</p>

<p>"Listen; my brother has arrived in London&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see that arrival announced in the papers."</p>

<p>"And he comes, empowered by the consent
of the Emperor, to ask the hand of a
relation and countrywoman of his; an alliance
that will heal long family dissensions,
and add to his own fortunes those of an heiress.
My brother, like myself, has been extravagant.
The dowry which by law he
still owes me it would distress him to pay till
this marriage be assured."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Randal. "But how
can I aid this marriage?"</p>

<p>"By assisting us to discover the bride.
She, with her father, sought refuge and concealment
in England."</p>

<p>"The father had, then, taken part in some
political disaffections, and was proscribed?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so; and so well has he concealed
himself that he has baffled all our efforts to
discover his retreat. My brother can obtain
him his pardon in cementing this alliance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Proceed."</p>

<p>"Ah Randal, Randal, is this the frankness
of friendship? You know that I have before
sought to obtain the secret of our relation's
retreat&mdash;sought in vain to obtain it from Mr.
Egerton, who assuredly knows it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But who communicates no secrets to
living man," said Randal, almost bitterly;
"who, close and compact as iron, is as little
malleable to me as to you."</p>

<p>"Pardon me. I know you so well that I
believe you could attain to any secret you
sought earnestly to acquire. Nay, more, I
believe that you know already that secret
which I ask you to share with me."</p>

<p>"What on earth makes you think so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</a></span></p>

<p>"When, some weeks ago you asked me to
describe the personal appearance and manners
of the exile, which I did partly from the
recollections of my childhood, partly from
the description given to me by others, I could
not but notice your countenance, and remark
its change; in spite," said the Marchesa, smiling,
and watching Randal while she spoke&mdash;"in
spite of your habitual self-command.
And when I pressed you to own that you
had actually seen some one who tallied with
that description, your denial did not deceive
me. Still more, when returning recently, of
your own accord, to the subject, you questioned
me so shrewdly as to my motives in
seeking the clue to our refugees, and I did
not then answer you satisfactorily, I could
detect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," interrupted Randal, with the low
soft laugh by which occasionally he infringed
upon Lord Chesterfield's recommendations to
shun a merriment so natural as to be ill-bred,&mdash;"ha,
ha, you have the fault of all observers
too minute and refined. But even granting
that I may have seen some Italian exiles,
(which is likely enough,) what could be more
simple than my seeking to compare your
description with their appearance; and granting
that I might suspect some one amongst
them to be the man you search for, what
more simple, also, than that I should desire
to know if you meant him harm or good in
discovering his 'whereabout?' For ill," added
Randal, with an air of prudery, "ill would it
become me to betray, even to friendship, the
retreat of one who would hide from persecution;
and even if I did so&mdash;for honor itself is a
weak safeguard against your fascinations&mdash;such
indiscretion might be fatal to my future
career."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Do you not say that Egerton knows the
secret, yet will not communicate?&mdash;and is he
a man who would ever forgive in me an
imprudence that committed himself? My
dear friend, I will tell you more. When
Audley Egerton first noticed my growing
intimacy with you, he said, with his usual
dryness of counsel, 'Randal, I do not ask you
to discontinue acquaintance with Madame di
Negra&mdash;for an acquaintance with women
like her forms the manners and refines the
intellect; but charming women are dangerous,
and Madame di Negra is&mdash;a charming
woman."</p>

<p>The Marchesa's face flushed. Randal resumed:
"'Your fair acquaintance' (I am
still quoting Egerton) 'seeks to discover the
home of a countryman of hers. She suspects
that I know it. She may try to learn it
through you. Accident may possibly give
you the information she requires. Beware
how you betray it. By one such weakness
I should judge of your general character.
He from whom a woman can extract a secret
will never be fit for public life.' Therefore,
my dear Marchesa, even supposing that I possess
this secret, you would be no true friend
of mine to ask me to reveal what would imperil
all my prospects. For as yet," added Randal,
with a gloomy shade on his brow,&mdash;"as yet I
do not stand alone and erect&mdash;I <i>lean</i>;&mdash;I am
dependent."</p>

<p>"There may be a way," replied Madame
di Negra, persisting, "to communicate this
intelligence, without the possibility of Mr.
Egerton's tracing our discovery to yourself;
and, though I will not press you further, I
add this&mdash;you urge me to accept your friend's
hand; you seem interested in the success
of his suit, and you plead it with a warmth
that shows how much you regard what you
suppose is his happiness; I will never accept
his hand till I can do so without blush for my
penury&mdash;till my dowry is secured, and that
can only be by my brother's union with the
exile's daughter. For your friend's sake,
therefore, think well how you can aid me in
the first step to that alliance. The young
lady once discovered, and my brother has no
fear for the success of his suit."</p>

<p>"And you would marry Frank if the
dower was secured?"</p>

<p>"Your arguments in his favor seem irresistible,"
replied Beatrice, looking down.</p>

<p>A flash went from Randal's eyes, and he
mused a few moments.</p>

<p>Then slowly rising, and drawing on his
gloves, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, at least you so far reconcile my
honor towards aiding your research, that
you now inform me that you mean no ill to
the exile."</p>

<p>"Ill!&mdash;the restoration to fortune, honors,
his native land."</p>

<p>"And you so far enlist my heart on your
side, that you inspire me with the hope to
contribute to the happiness of two friends
whom I dearly love. I will therefore diligently
seek to ascertain if, among the refugees
I have met with, lurk those whom
you seek; and if so I will thoughtfully
consider how to give you the clue. Meanwhile,
not one incautious word to Egerton."</p>

<p>"Trust me&mdash;I am a woman of the world."</p>

<p>Randal now had gained the door. He
paused, and renewed carelessly&mdash;</p>

<p>"This young lady must be heiress to great
wealth, to induce a young man of your brother's
rank to take so much pains to discover her."</p>

<p>"Her wealth <i>will</i> be vast," replied the
Marchesa; "and if any thing from wealth or
influence in a foreign state could be permitted
to prove my brother's gratitude&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, fie," interrupted Randal, and approaching
Madame di Negra, he lifted her
hand to his lips, and said gallantly.</p>

<p>"This is reward enough to your <i>preux
chevalier</i>."</p>

<p>With those words he took his leave.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is always safe to call an assailer of morality
licentious, though many of its defenders
be not virtuous.</p>

<h2><a name="Authors_and_Books" id="Authors_and_Books">Authors and Books.</a></h2>


<p>A pendant to Professor Creasy's <i>Decisive
Battles</i> has been issued at Stuttgart, under
the title of <i>Grundz&uuml;ge einer Einleitung zum
Studium der Kriegsgeschichte</i> (Outlines of an
Introduction to the History of War). The
author divides his work into two parts: the
first extending from 550 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> to <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1350;
the second, from 1350 to 1850; and each of
these parts he arranges in three periods. In
the first period (550 to 250 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), he finds that
the controlling part in war must be attributed
to distinguished and leading individualities;
in the second (250 to 50 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), that the dominant
element was the political and national,
especially the peculiar constitution and nationality
of the Romans; the third (50 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
to 1350 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>), is remarkable for the number
and variety of warlike events, and the gradual
decline of the system used in prosecuting
wars; in the fourth (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1350 to 1650),
the art of war was greatly advanced, especially
in respect to technical science, fortifications,
&amp;c.; in the fifth (1650 to 1790), this
progress continued, and tactics were greatly
improved as well as strategy; the sixth period
(1790 to 1850), is remarkable for the rapid
development of every branch of warlike
art and science, both theoretical and practical.
These conclusions are arrived at after a
spirited historical review of the different
periods. This introduction the author promises
to follow up with a complete work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An interesting correspondence of the period
of the thirty years' war has been discovered
by M. Welchoff, Councillor of State,
in an old travelling trunk in the archives
of the Aulic chamber of Celle, in Hanover,
that did not appear to have been opened
since the papers were deposited. It comes
down to the date of the battle of Breitenfeld,
and includes letters from Pappenheim,
Gustavus Adolphus, and other leaders of the
time, with the rough draughts of the letters
of Duke George of Brunswick, Luneberg, to
whom the whole collection probably belonged.
A similar discovery was lately made by
M. Dudik, commissioned by the government
of Austria to search the libraries of Sweden
for material of this kind, in Stockholm and
Upsal. The history of the thirty years' war
has therefore to be rewritten.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Albion and Erin</i>, is the title of a little
volume, containing the choicest songs of
Moore, Byron, Burns, Shelley, Campbell, and
Thompson, with selections from Percy's Reliques,
each piece being accompanied by a
faithful and elegant translation into German,
printed on the opposite page. For American
students of German, or German students of
English, nothing better could be desired.

<p>The thirteenth meeting of the Association
of German Philologists, Teachers and Orientalists,
was opened at Erlangen on the 1st of
October, and continued four days, about one
hundred and eighty members being present.
B&ouml;ckh of Berlin, Thiersch, Halm and Spengel
of Munich, Gerlach of Basle, Grotefend of
Hanover, Kr&uuml;ger of Brunswick, were among
the most distinguished <i>gelehrten</i>. There was
even one member from Russia in the person
of Prof. Vater of Kasan. Austria and Electoral
Hesse were not represented. Professor
D&ouml;derlein was president, and Professor Nagelsbach
vice-president. The president opened
the general session with a discourse upon
the position and value of modern philology.
In the meeting of October 2d, Wocher of
Ehrinegn read an essay on phonology, or the
essential significance of sounds; and Beyer of
Erlangen, another on an antique statue in the
Munich collection which had been supposed
to represent Leukothea, but which he demonstrated
to be Charitas. In the exercises of
the third and fourth day were included an essay
by B&ouml;ckh on a Greek inscription, one by
D&ouml;derlein on an ode of Horace, one by Nagelsbach
on a passage of the Iliad, and one
by Gerlach on a subject from Roman antiquities.
The whole, however interesting to advanced
scholars, had little to attract or satisfy
the mass of intelligent persons.</p>

<p>The third volume of G. <span class="smcap">Weil's</span> <i>Geschichte der
Chalifen</i> (History of the Califs), has appeared
in Germany, where the second was published
three years since. This volume brings the
history down into the period of the crusades,
and gives us the exact life of men of such
proportions as Haroun Alrashid, and Saladin.
In ordinary cases when history enters the
field where romance has achieved its most
brilliant successes, it must be written with
the utmost power not to seem pale and lifeless
by contrast, but here the simplest narrative
would have all the charm of fancy. For
the rest Mr. Weil is fully equal to his subject;
and throws a flood of light upon its more recondite
features. His work is an invaluable
addition to our means of knowing the history
and natives of the Orient.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Die Deutschen in B&ouml;hmen</i> (The Germans in
Bohemia), is pleasant reading for those who
like to study the manners and peculiarities of
foreign countries in some detail. It also has
its value for the political student who would
make himself acquainted with the intermixtures
and relations of the different races in
Central Europe. It treats the subject in its
geographical, statistical, economical and historical
bearings, as well as in respect to manners,
customs, and modes of life. (Prague,
1851.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</a></span></p>

<p>We are indebted to the Messrs. Westermann,
of this city, for the ninth and tenth parts
of Dr. <span class="smcap">Andree's</span> admirable work, entitled,
<i>Amerika</i>, of which we have before spoken at
length. These parts conclude the first volume,
of 810 octavo pages, printed with an
elegance which, among us, is not generally
attributed to German books. This volume is
devoted to North America, and these two
parts, are divided into chapters upon:&mdash;the
New England States; the Middle States; the
Southern Atlantic States; the South on the
Gulf of Mexico; the Western Slave States;
the Non-slaveholding, West and North; the
Far West, and the Pacific Coast. Each state
and territory is treated with extreme clearness
and comprehensiveness, and with a correctness
that seems astonishing, when we
consider that the book was written in Germany.
This volume is dedicated to Dr. Hermann
E. Ludewig, of this city, in three or
four pages, giving an account of the motives
which induced Dr. Andree to write the work;
we translate the dedicatory paragraph: "This
book, honored sir, I dedicate to you. The
literature of North American history is greatly
indebted to your valuable labors; for these
ten years no small part of your time has been
devotedly spent in disinterestedly aiding, by
advice and assistance, our emigrating countrymen
on their arrival in New-York. In
your new country, which you understand so
keenly and so profoundly, you are still a cultivator
of German science, holding your old
fatherland in appropriate honor. You are in
America a worthy and most estimable representative
of German culture and German integrity.
Receive friendly this inscription,
and the cordial greetings I send you beyond
the sea!" We trust the other volumes of
this work may speedily appear: the second
will be upon Mexico and Central America,
and the third upon South America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spinoza's</span> <i>Tractatus Politicus</i> is the subject
of a work recently published at Dessau,
by J. E. <span class="smcap">Horn</span>. The author defends Spinoza's
political ideas as of a practical nature, and
not at all connected with the analogous
theories of modern German metaphysicians.
The work is the result of much thought, and
of all the industry which seems to belong to
every scholar of Germany.</p>

<p>Another work on Spinoza, is by Professor
<span class="smcap">Zimmermann</span> of Olm&uuml;tz, and is entitled, <i>Uber
einige logische Fehler der spinozistischen
Ethik</i>. It attempts to prove at length that
the syllogistic method of the great Jew can
only be correct on the supposition that in
substance the idea and the reality are coincident,
which supposition Spinoza himself expressly
affirms. The radical fault of this method,
according to the Professor, is the application
of mathematical demonstration to
things not susceptible thereof. On the whole
this publication adds little to the treasures of
philosophy.</p>

<p>Another, and a valuable contribution, to
the almost infinite G&oelig;thean literature, has
appeared in Germany, in the second volume
of J. W. <span class="smcap">Schafer's</span> life of the great poet. It
begins with the year 1786, and comes down
to the death of the modern Shakespeare. Its
materials are drawn from the writings of
Goethe himself, and from the published letters
and memoirs upon separate portions of his
life. The Italian Journey is the subject of a
special disquisition. Goethe's political opinions
are also discussed in connection with
his behavior during the war of independence.
Finally, we have the man in his old age,
when his leading feature of character is said
to be universality of mental activity. The style
of the book is clear and condensed, and its fairness
and impartiality a subject of laudation.</p>

<p>A third volume of <span class="smcap">Goethe's</span> <i>Correspondence
with Madame von Stein</i> has been published
in Germany. It is no less interesting
than the preceding, whether as a collection
of letters, or as a revelation of the character
and private history of the greatest man in
German literature. The assertion that Goethe
was really a man of cold and heartless nature,
and that the warmth of feeling and freshness
of sentiment displayed in his poems was
merely fictitious, is entirely refuted by this
correspondence.</p>

<p>A collection of poems, by <span class="smcap">Wolfgang von
Goethe</span>, the son of the great poet, was published
by Cotta, of Stuttgart, in October last.
We have not seen the book, but the publisher's
advertisement is quite apologetic, and indicates
that the name of the father has not
insured the inheritance of his genius.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A new work entitled <i>Das Brittische Reich
in Europe</i> (The British Empire in Europe),
has just appeared at Leipzig, in which the
progress and power of England are compared
with those of the United States. The author,
Herr <span class="smcap">Meidinger</span>, is an admirer of the present
policy of England, and exhibits at length the
statistics of the advance made by the country
under that policy. A statistical survey of the
religious and moral condition of Ireland, which
forms a part of the work, has also been printed
as a separate book.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Students of middle-age antiquities may
find a bone to gnaw in <i>Dat Spil fan der Upstandinge</i>
(The Play of the Resurrection), just
published with annotations by Herr <span class="smcap">Ettmuller</span>
at Quedlinburg. This is said to be greatly
superior to the mass of the religious dramas
of the time; it has a genuine unity and is not
disfigured by the admixture of buffoonery
with the awful realities of New Testament
history. It is in the Low German dialect,
and dates from the fifteenth century.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A good history of French literature has
been published in German by Professor <span class="smcap">Kreysig</span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span></p>

<p>A valuable contribution to German history
has been brought out at Berlin, by <span class="smcap">Kurd
von Sch&ouml;zer</span>, under the title of <i>Die Hansa
und der Deutsche Ritterorden in den Ostseel&auml;nden</i>
(The Hanseatic League and the German
Knighthood in the Baltic provinces).
The author has not merely exhausted the old
chronicles of his subject in the archives and
libraries of Germany, but has wrought up his
materials into a living narrative, full of romantic
interest as well as historical instruction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Catholic writer, Count <span class="smcap">Eichendorff</span>,
has published, at Leipzig, <i>Der Deutsche Roman
des 18ten Jahrhunderts</i> (German Romance
in the 18th century), in which the subject of
romance literature is treated in its relation to
Christianity, but not in a thorough or profound
manner, and with too much dogmatism,
and apparent prejudice. His idea is,
that there is no Christianity outside of the
Catholic Church, and that all novels which
are not Catholic are unchristian.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Blaze de Bury</span> has just published
at Bremen, in Germany, a novel, entitled,
<i>Falkenburg</i>, which was issued at the same
time in English by Colburn, in London. The
German copy is the work of the authoress
herself. She resides, at Paris, as the wife of
the well-known <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>, Henri Blaze.
This novel is certainly a cosmopolitan production&mdash;written
as it is, in German, by an
Englishwoman, married to a Frenchman, and
residing at Paris.</p>

<p>The history of religious organizations is enriched
by Professor <span class="smcap">Richter's</span> <i>Geschichte der

(History of the Constitution of the Evangelical

and, we doubt not, very justly commended.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An elaborate <i>Life of Sir Robert Peel</i>, with
a collection of his speeches, has been published
in German, by Herr <span class="smcap">Kunzel</span>. It is a

reform by which England is distinguished.

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Zimmermann</span>, whose excellent history
of the Peasants' War deserves to be better

at Darmstadt, a history of the English Revolution,
which he dedicates to all parties of
the German people, and which we doubt not
all parties may profitably study.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A history of Norway has been published
at Leipzig, in a neat little volume. It brings
the narrative of that country down to the
present time, dividing it into seven periods,
and giving a succinct account of each. The
history of Andreas Faye serves as the basis
of this work.</p>

<p>We gave in these pages, a few months since,
an account of the labors and sufferings of the
Hungarian traveller and ethnographer <span class="smcap">Reguly</span>,
who spent ten painful years among the
Finnish tribes of Northern Europe and Asia,
with a view to ascertain the ancient of the
Magyars. Reguly is now hard at work at
Pesth arranging for publication the immense
mass of materials gathered on this long expedition,
and meanwhile another savan, John
Jerney, has just published in two heavy quartos
the result of a journey he made for the
same purpose during 1844 and '45, in Southern
Russia. His work is interesting rather
from its information on collateral subjects
than because he has cleared up the main
problem which his explorations had in view.
His conclusion is that the Magyars are of Parthian
origin.</p>

<p>In the present attention to recent Magyar
history, a useful aid may be found in <i>Ungarn's
Politische Charaktere</i> (The Political

admirer of Kossuth and his policy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A collection of the speeches, proclamations,

May 31, 1851, and will be useful to trunk-makers

<p>The success in Europe of General <span class="smcap">Bem's</span>
plan of teaching history and an exact chronology,
attracted the attention of intelligent
friends of education in Massachusetts, at whose
suggestion Miss E. P. <span class="smcap">Peabody</span> has prepared
a system of the same sort for American
schools. The plan was not one superseding
the necessity of study, but guiding it, and rendering
it effective. It requires a very careful
attention, which may be slighted either by
scholar or teacher. It saves time, indeed, by
rewarding labor, and by making the everlasting
review of the ground unnecessary,
fostering by means of the senses what is attained.
Miss Peabody, in the appendix to
the tables of chronology which form the
manual of this system, has aimed to give some
general hints to teachers, opening out before
them a more generous method of studying
history than has been usual in our schools
and colleges.</p>

<p>The French democrats and socialists bring
out this year the usual variety of Almanacs
for the propagation of their doctrines among
the people. The <i>Almanach du Travail</i> contains
articles by Agricole Perdiguier, cabinet-maker
and representative in the National Assembly;
M. Perdiguier is understood to be
the original hero of George Sand's <i>Compagnons
du Tour de France</i>; several other well-known
literary and political characters also
contribute; the publication of the work is the
enterprise of an association of printers and engravers.
The <i>Almanach du Village</i> is published
by the <i>Propagande D&eacute;mocratique Europ&eacute;ene</i>;
its editor is M. Joigneaux, a representative,
and Pierre Dupont, the democratic
poet, is among the contributors. The <i>Almanach
Populaire de la France</i> is a more elaborate
publication, and boasts a larger circle of
writers; Pascal Duprat, Alphonse Esquiros,
Andr&eacute; Cochut, Fr. Arago, and Victor Schoelcher,
are among them. The <i>Almanach des
Opprim&eacute;s</i>, by Hippolyte Magen, is a Voltairian
production, devoted to ridiculing the Catholic
clergy and the saints of the calender in a
style of utter irreverence for their sacred
character, and even for their integrity and respectability
as individuals. The <i>R&eacute;pubilique du
Peuple</i> is simply a democratic almanac, but
its ability is remarkable. Arago, the astronomer
Carnot, who possibly will be the candidate
of the democratic party for President,
Colonel Charras, Michel (de Bourges), Alphonse
Karr, and others of the old moderate
republican party are contributors. It is
adorned with neat engravings; among them
is a portrait of Dupont, the poet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A well-known publicist, <span class="smcap">M. Croce-Spinelli</span>,
has just issued at Paris an essay on popular
government, under the title of <i>L'Arche
Populaire</i>. It treats principally of the French
constitution, whose faults are said to be&mdash;1st,
that it confides too much in aristocracy and
too little in democracy; 2d, that the legislature
may render itself independent of the
people by whom it is elected, and betray their
interests: 3d, that the authority of the President
is too great, and is even dangerous to
the development of democratic ideas and
forces. The author concludes his work with
the plan of a constitution which he thinks
will be free from these defects.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <span class="smcap">Asiatic Society</span> of Paris announces
the publication of a collection of Oriental
works, with French translations, without
commentaries, but with very copious indexes.
The majority will be Arabic, and, with few
exceptions, hitherto unknown to Occidental
students generally. The prices will be made
very low, it is hoped not higher than those of
ordinary French books. This will be accomplished
by introducing them as text-books into
the schools in Algiers, Egypt, and Constantinople,
where French is taught, and thus
securing a large sale.</p>

<p>A publication worthy of the utmost praise
is the <i>Revue de l'Architecture et des Travaux
Publiques</i>, published at Paris, under the editorial
care of <span class="smcap">M. Cesar Daly</span>, one of the most
learned and accomplished architects in Europe.
This review, which is now in its ninth
year, is issued monthly, with the utmost elegance
both of typography and engravings.
The number for October contains articles on
the following subjects:&mdash;the preservation
and restoration of the Cathedrals of France,
the Church of St. Paul at Nismes, Stereochromy,
the Museum at St. Petersburg, Chinese
Monuments discovered in Ireland, the Public
Garden and Swimming School at Bordeaux,
&amp;c., &amp;c.; it has four large engravings. The
work treats every branch, historic and practical,
of architecture and engineering, and
should be in the hands of every architect and
engineer, and in the library of every man of
taste whose leisure and meditations lead him
to the study of the beautiful and useful arts.
It may be procured in Paris at the low rate
of 40 francs a-year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A book well suited to the times is Dr.
<span class="smcap">Figuier's</span> <i>Exposition et Histoire des principales
D&eacute;couvertes Modernes</i>, which has just
appeared at Paris in two small volumes. It
treats of photography, the serial and magnetic
telegraphs, etherization, galvanoplasty
and chemical gilding, a&euml;rostatics, lighting by
gas, Leverrier's planet, gunpowder, and gun-cotton.
With respect to the glory of discovering
photography, Dr. Figuier restores it to
M. Niepce, of Chalon-sur-Saone, proving that
he originated the conception, and that Daguerre
did nothing more than perfect the
process. Singularly enough, M. Figuier omits
the steamboat and railroad from the discoveries
whose history he so carefully and conscientiously
records, but even with these
omissions his work is valuable and interesting
both to the savan and the ordinary reader.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The editors of the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>,
at Paris, have made up a very useful manual
of the history of the year 1850, under the
title of <i>Annuaire des Deux Mondes</i>, which is
sold by Balli&eacute;re, in Broadway. It contains
an account of the political events, the international
relations and diplomacy, the administration,
commerce, and finances, and the
periodical press and literature of every country
which possesses those products of civilization.
The constitutions and affairs of Italy,
Denmark, Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland,
Spain, Portugal, England, Norway,
Sweden, Russia, Turkey, Greece, United
States, Mexico, the South American Republics,
and even of the African and Asiatic
races, are discussed with moderation and an
effort for impartiality, which is laudable, if
not always successful. The most recent
statistics are given with reference to every
country; and, as a book of reference, it will
be found very useful.</p>

<p>The <i>Calvin Translation Society</i>, which for
the last ten years has been issuing, at irregular
intervals, a complete and very handsome
edition of <span class="smcap">Calvin's</span> works, in English&mdash;to
make about fifty octavo volumes&mdash;will have
to add to them a new collection of his <i>Letters</i>.
It appears that the government of Louis Philippe
committed the preparation of the Unpublished
Letters of the great Reformer to
Professor <span class="smcap">Bonnett</span>, who had been dismissed
from the College of Nismes for speaking too
highly of Luther. He travelled in France
and Switzerland, at the expense of the Government,
in order to collect the letters.
After the revolution, the influence of the Catholic
clergy was such that the new minister
of Public Instruction found a thousand difficulties
in the way of accepting the labor of
M. Bonnett, and the subject was finally referred
to a committee, who reported in favor
of the publication; yet, to split the difference
with the clergy, they, on pretence of a saving
of expenses, ordered that some of the less important
letters should be omitted, and that
the Latin and French letters should be published
together in the same volume. The
number of Calvin's unpublished letters in the
collection is 497; of these 190 are in French,
and 307 in Latin.</p>

<p>The aged <span class="smcap">Lacretelle</span>, who of late years
has lived in retirement near Macon, reposing
upon his fame as an historian, appeared recently
at the Academy in that city, on the
day when the prizes of the Agricultural Society
were distributed, and delivered an oration,
marked by the energy and force of
youth, but not by its hopefulness. He is
now eighty-five years old; and on this occasion,
was particularly severe against the communists
and socialists, who, he thought, were
bent on destroying every thing good, and upsetting
the world. This was uttered with a
point and bitterness that did no discredit to
the censor of the press under both the Empire
and the Restoration.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">M. Romain Corunt</span> has commenced, in <i>La
Presse</i>, a series of Critical Studies on Socialism,
which M. Girardin introduces with a
special editorial, and which promises to be
valuable. It was not originally designed for
publication, but to satisfy its author's curiosity
as to the ideas and aims of the revolution
of 1848. He has accordingly gone analytically
through the writings of all the socialist
schools. He commences his exposition with
Auguste Comte.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">French</span> publisher advertises the memoirs
of the celebrated actress Mademoiselle
<span class="smcap">Mars</span>, who died at a great age some half dozen
years ago. Like those of Pompadour, Crequi,
Dubarri, Fouche, Robespierre, and many others,
they will undoubtedly turn out to be a fabrication
by some ingenious literary trickster,
yet it is probable that they will be amusing.</p>

<p>The five academies of the Institute of
France held their annual meeting on the
25th of October. M. de Tocqueville presiding.
In opening the meeting, the chairman
delivered a discourse, which is praised as possessing
"a great conciseness and an exquisite
sense." Its topic was the aim of this annual
reunion of the five divisions of the Institute.
The Volney prize, which had been competed
for by ten different works, was awarded to
Dr. <span class="smcap">Steinthal</span>, for a manuscript treatise,
written in German, called <i>A Comparative
Exposition of a Family of Negro Languages,
in its Phonetic and Psychological Aspects</i>.
This family of languages is that spoken by
the Yoloffs and Bambaras. This prize is
simply 1200 francs; it was established by the
famous Volney, with a view to aid in the
formation of a universal language. An equal
prize was also awarded by the Institute to
Dr. M. S. <span class="smcap">Munk</span>, for his work on <i>Sundry Hebrew
Grammarians of the Tenth Century</i>;
and an honorable mention to Dr. <span class="smcap">Lorenz
Dieffenbach</span>, for his <i>Comparative Dictionary
of the Gothic Language</i>. These three
gentlemen are Germans, and it is not surprising
that they should thus carry off the
honors where the field of competition is philology.
After the prizes had been announced,
a memoir on the Physical Constitution of the
Sun and the Stars, by M. Arago, of the Academy
of Sciences, was read; then a biographical
notice of Denon, by M. de Pastoret,
of the Academy of Fine Arts. M. Wallon
next read a fragment on the right of asylum
awarded to runaway slaves in antiquity,
and attempted to prove that a similar disposition
to help such fugitives exists in the
United States at the present day. Finally, a
poem, sent by M. Ampere, was read, and received
with a great deal of applause.</p>

<p>An interesting work on the war in the
Vend&eacute;e, in 1793, is now published at Paris,
by M. <span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;ois Grille</span>, himself a native of
the region, and an eye-witness of some of the
most terrible scenes of that sanguinary struggle.
He is a republican, and naturally takes
a somewhat different view from that of Madame
de la Rochejaquelin's Memoirs. Indeed,
he corrects explicitly several geographical
and historical errors into which she
has fallen. He writes with vivacity and
clearness, and has made a conscientious study
of a great variety of materials hitherto unused.
The first volume of the book has alone
appeared: the others will follow with all
possible expedition.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Francis Lacombe</span> is the author of a
newly-published <i>Histoire de la Bourgeoisie de

Lacombe has well employed the most extensive
materials in treating it. His work extends
to three pretty large octavo volumes.

<p>During the autumn of 1849, the French
government formed from among the members
of the Institute, a commission whose duty
was to select from the reports and communications
made to the government by scientific
travellers, what should appear of value to the
world at large, for publication at the public
expense, in monthly parts, under the title of
<i>Archives des Missions Scientifiques et Litt&eacute;raires</i>.
The work was at once commenced and
the volume for 1850 is completed; of the volume
for 1851, not more than three or four
parts have yet appeared. In this volume are
reports by Emil Burnouf on the Propylae, the
Pnyx and the Copaic Lake; by M. Bendit of
a Journey among the Grecian Islands; by
Lottin de Leval of an expedition to the Peninsula
of Sinai to take impressions of the inscriptions
in the valleys of Sinai and Serval;
by M.H. Revier of an excursion in Algeria
to collect Roman inscriptions; M. Battier de
Bourville has an interesting account of the
result of an expedition from Benghazi on the
coast of Tripoli, to Cyrene, where he made
some excavations and dug up several fine
statues and remarkable inscriptions; M. Ducouret
repeats at length the story of tailed
men in the interior of Africa, but his veracity
is uncommonly doubtful, and his previous
travels in countries more familiar have been
utterly fruitless; Mariette's report of his journey
to Egypt, in which he discovered the Serapeum
of Memphis, is particularly interesting.
He is a man of uncommon energy and persistence,
and almost lost his life in the affair.
He was sick four weeks with fevers and ophthalmia,
in the desert, where the Egyptian officials
refused him water and provisions, so
that the wonder is he did not die. The
Assembly has voted 30,000 francs to dig out
the Serapeum, which was covered with sand
in Pliny's time, and will now be found exactly
in its antique condition. Mariette is
now there, and at the last advices had excavated
five hundred different objects in bronze
besides twelve sphinxes in granite. Very
many travellers have been sent out to collect
documents bearing upon the history of France,
and a full account of their labors is contained
in this volume. M. de Maslatire has been
twice to Cyprus to obtain materials for the
history of French rule in that island, and the
result will presently appear in two quarto
volumes at the cost of the treasury. Several
travellers have been sent to England for documents
on French history, where it seems
they are almost inexhaustibly abundant, especially
those that relate to the middle ages.
The reports of M. Descloiseaux, who was sent
to Iceland to study its geological formation;
of M. Visquenel who went to Asiatic Turkey
to examine the soil and products; of MM.
Milne, Edwards and Quatrefages, who went
to Sicily to examine the molluscs and annelids
of the neighboring seas; and of Dr.
Grange, who was sent throughout Europe to
study cretinism and goitre, are very valuable
scientifically. Dr. Grange finds the cause of
those diseases in water containing magnesia,
but no iodine.</p>

<p>These travels are undertaken by means of
a fund provided for that purpose by the government.
The plan of each expedition is
first submitted to the Institute and approved.
In case of very expensive undertakings, like
the excavation of the Serapeum, or the expedition
lately sent to Babylon, a special appropriation
is obtained from the Assembly. The
<i>Archives</i> are published neatly, with the necessary
engravings, at twelve francs a year.</p>

<p>The mystery hanging over the interior of
Africa is rapidly dissipating before the zeal of
the many explorers whose efforts are now
devoted to traversing the centre of that continent,
and, before many years have passed,
there is reason to suppose, this sole remaining
geographical and ethnographic problem
will be fully solved. The English expeditions
from the Cape of Good Hope, the German
missionaries on the eastern coast, with their
journeys into the highlands in the south of
Abyssinia, the explorations of the English on
the gold coast and up the Niger, those of the
French starting from Senegal and Algiers,
the travels of Knoblecher and others on the
upper Nile, with the journeys of Richardson,
Barth, and Overweg, must soon make us
acquainted with the principal facts that have
so long been the object of general curiosity,
if not of exaggerated expectation. Something
is also to be anticipated from the aid of
Mohammedan travellers, of whom there are
a great number scattered over the interior of
the continent in search of adventures or with
a view to make fortunes. One of these has
published, in Arabic, two works containing
his experiences and observations in Darfur
and Waday, both of which have been translated
into French by M. Perron. The second
has just appeared at Paris under the title of
<i>Voyage au Ouaday par Cheykh Mohammed
Ibn Omar al Tunisi</i>, and is especially valuable,
as Waday is a country about which we
have before had little, if any, positive information.
It lies south of the great desert between
Timbuctoo and Darfur, and is an extensive
country. It is so far advanced out of
the merely savage state, as to have a sort of
administration, an army, and a kind of general
regulations for commerce, which it owes
to the influence of Islamism, and to a great
man called Sabun, who lived quite recently,
or yet lives, as the chief ruler of the land.
The principal trade is in slaves, who are
stolen in forays among the neighboring tribes
on the south, and sold to caravans going
north to Fezzan, or east to Darfur; the other
articles of commerce are ivory, skins, and ostrich
feathers. The introduction of Islamism
has put an end to human sacrifices, and rendered
the tyranny of the rulers less bloody, but
in other respects it has produced little social
improvement.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic writers are generally,
in Continental Europe, demanding the suppression
of the liberty of discussion, and a
re-establishment of the Inquisition. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Blanc St. Bonnet</span>, one of the most conspicuous
writers of his party, demands that
every species of free thought be discountenanced,
and M. <span class="smcap">Barbey d'Aurevilly</span>, in <i>Les
Proph&egrave;tes du Pass&eacute;</i>, declares that the evil
corrupting society is the pest Liberty; that
the church made a fatal error in not burning
Luther in lieu of burning his books; and
he concludes that the Inquisition is a "logical
necessity" in every well-constituted state.</p>

<p>The <i>Journal des D&eacute;bats</i> publishes a long
review from the pen of M. <span class="smcap">Gardin de Tassy</span>,
of the <i>Translation of two unpublished Arabic
Documents</i>, issued last year by our countryman
<span class="smcap">Edward E. Salisbury</span>, of Boston. M.
de Tassy says: "We must not suppose that in
the United States every body is so absorbed
in commerce that nothing else can possibly be
attended to. Science and letters are cultivated
with success, and there are learned men
there who rival those of Europe." The <i>Translation</i>
and its author are warmly praised.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">de Saulcy</span> is about to publish at Paris
his travels in Palestine, with thirty large engravings
of the ancient monuments about Jerusalem,
and thirty of those about the Dead
Sea. The so-called Graves of the Kings will
be the subject of thorough discussion. It is
also said that one of them will be reconstructed
in the Louvre upon his plan, and a sarcophagus
cover, which he brought with
him, used for the purpose. He has also a
Moabitic bas-relief in black basalt: he bought
it of the Arabs on the Dead Sea. If it be indeed
what he supposes, it is the only relic of
the sort existing in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbadie</span>, one of the Ethiopian travellers of

a complete font of Ethiopic letters, at Paris,
to be used in printing some two hundred and
fifty Ethiopian manuscripts. They will form
four printed volumes, and are said to be
among the most beautiful specimens of chirography

<p>There are a great number of French missionaries
in Asia and Africa, but their contributions
to literature are trifling, compared
with those of the English, American, and
German. Bishop <span class="smcap">Pallegoix</span>, in Siam, has
lately published a Siamese grammar, in Latin,
and promises a Lexicon of the same language.
This, and the Cochin-Chinese Lexicon
of Bishop Tabert, are the only works of
the kind, by French missionaries, which we
can recall for several years.</p>

<p>The <i>Westminster Review</i>, as we have before
intimated, has passed into the hands of the infidel
party of England, and it becomes necessary
to warn the public who subscribe for it
in the series of republications by Mr Scott, of
its character, and to urge Mr. Scott to select
some other periodical in its place, if it is necessary
for the completion of his contracts to
reprint a certain number of such works.
There are a considerable number of charlatans
in England and in this country who,
without the natural capacities or the learning
necessary to distinction in any legitimate
intellectual pursuits, clothe themselves in the
cast-off and forgotten draperies of French
scepticism, and challenge admiration for the
bravery displayed in mocking God, and ridiculing
the most profoundly reasoned and
firmly settled convictions of mankind. It is
becoming fashionable among our young and
imperfectly educated magazine and newspaper
writers to "pity the weakness" which
receives the Christian religion as it was held
by our fathers. The drivel of which the
veriest fools were made ashamed half a century
ago, is revived as if it were a new and
immortal flowering of philosophy. By the
wise and thoughtful this sort of stuff is regarded
with just contempt, and with confidence
that though it may exist for a while as
scum upon the surface, it will before long
sink with kindred filth to the bottom of the
stream. The <i>Westminster Review</i>, failing of
an adequate support, was about to be discontinued,
when John Chapman, the infidel publisher,
bought it, and John Stuart Mill was
engaged to be its editor. We hope the respectable
portion of the American journals
will make haste to disclose its present character;
that Christian parents will no longer
receive it into their houses; and that the
characteristic dishonesty of attempting to
smuggle writings of philosophical quacks and
mountebanks under a once reputable name,
will have its appropriate reward.</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Robert Burns</span>, a grandson of the great
poet, who has recently had some difficulties
with the Rajah Sir James Brooke, the London
<i>Examiner</i> says, that he is an adventurous traveller;
that he has mastered two of the languages
of Borneo; that he has penetrated
farther into that great and little-known island
than any other European; that he has written
by far the best and most authentic account
of it in the <i>Journal of the Archipelago</i>, that
has ever been given to the public.</p>

<p>The English Dissenters have recently established
a new college. It is the result of a
union of three existing similar institutions,
at present belonging to the Independents&mdash;namely,
Coward, Homerton, and Cheshunt
Colleges; and it is anticipated, from such a
concentration of Nonconformist resources
and energies, that the standard of learning
among them will be raised still higher than
it is at present, though it is not now below
that in the established church, which, controlling
the great universities, is pleased not
to admit that a man may understand Greek
or Mathematics unless he subscribes to the
thirty-nine articles.</p>

thereupon declares that, "In proportion as
any branch of inquiry rises out of mere <i>details</i>
into the <i>higher generalizations</i> which alone
constitute science, we find our scientific men,

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Evening Book</i>, by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Kirkland</span>
(Charles Scribner), is a very tasteful volume,
consisting of some of the cleverest compositions
of one of our very cleverest literary
women, well known as Mrs. Mary Clavers,
the prose poetess, and pen-painter of Western
life. From our first acquaintance with
Mary Clavers, in the world of print, we have
admired, almost equally, her frank independence
of word and thought, her free and fearless
love of truth, her facility in vivid and
life-like portraiture, and her natural strain of
good-natured humor. But most of all we
have admired her, for that she is "an 'author,'
<i>yet a woman too</i>!" a consummation indeed
devoutly to be wished; inasmuch as it seems
to us, that we are fast falling upon days
which will induce the grave spectator, looking
upon the ladies and gentlemen of <i>Young
New-York</i>, the former in the rostrum, the
latter in the ball-room, to exclaim with the
Persian King at Salamis, "All our men have
become women, and our women <i>men</i>." This,
however, can never be predicated of our
friend of "the New Home;" and yet, shall
we confess it, we like her better far in the
broad west than on the Broad <i>pav&eacute;</i>; better
in the solitude of the great woods than on
the society of great cities; better in the log
school-house, than in the tumultuous streets&mdash;in
a word, better as the chronicler of the
doings of the west, than as the critic of the
goings-on in the east! So long as she adheres
to the former, she is ever entertaining,
ever instructive, ever humorous, ever lively,
ever true; but when she comes to deal with
the problems of society, when she dives into
the mysteries of <i>caste</i>, and tempts the difficulties
which lie in the way of those who
would reconcile political equality with social
intercourse, we fear that she will not only be
found herself going astray, but&mdash;what is far
worse&mdash;becoming a blind guide to others.
We are led to these remarks especially by a
certain article on "Streets and Servants, at
home and abroad," the tendency of which
we fully believe&mdash;though we are sure it was
honestly written, and beneficently intended&mdash;to
be positively dangerous and injurious to the
very class for whose advantage it is intended.</p>

<p>Herein we find our fair friend discoursing
thus of the female servants of America:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Perhaps, if we could make up our minds to
treat our servants as fellow-citizens now, the time
when they would be disposed to shake off our service
might be deferred."</p></div>

<p>And again&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Would it be dangerous to recognize the soul
of a chambermaid? Would it not be apt to make
her a better one, and longer content with the
broom and duster, if we consulted her feelings,
expressed an interest in her welfare, and saved
her pride as much as possible? At present, it
seems to be supposed that in the agreement as to
wages, a certain amount of contumely is bargained
for," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Now this is quite unworthy of Mrs. Kirkland's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</a></span>
good sense; it is very objectionable
and injurious at this moment&mdash;when tens of
thousands of American girls are daily all but
starving on the wretched pittance which
they can earn at the literally starving prices
of the shops; daily falling into vice and infamy
in order to avoid actual starvation;
who might be comfortably lodged, comfortably
clad, comfortably fed, and well paid, in as
many kindly and Christian families, if they
could but condescend from their ruinous false
pride, and brook to become servants. Worst
of all, it is not <i>true</i>. In no country on earth
are servants so well looked to, not only as to
wants but as to comforts, as in this. In no
other are their labors so light, their liberties
so large, their remuneration so liberal, their
feelings so freely consulted&mdash;nay, in many
cases, their whims so foolishly indulged. To
no contumely, that we can perceive, are they
subjected; but we suppose that Mrs. Kirkland
regards their non-admission to our tables,
our conversational <i>reunions</i>, or our ballrooms,
as the crowning contumely&mdash;quite
forgetful that the restraint of what to refined,
educated, and highly-bred persons are habits,
would be to the servant-girl bonds and fetters
of intolerable restraint&mdash;that her inability to
mix in our conversation, to see with our eyes,
taste with our tastes, and understand with
our cultivated intellects, would render our
society far more insufferable and annoying to
her than her presence could be to us; in a
word, that, but for the false pride of being
<i>one of the company</i>, our drawing-room would
be far more a place of punishment to her,
than her kitchen to us.</p>

<p>For the rest, in these United States, all this
talk about independence and servitude is absurd.
No man on earth is, or ever will be,
independent of some other man. Every man
is, in some sort or other, the servant of some
other man. The rich man is dependent on
his colored barber, or his colored <i>boots</i>, for
his comfort, as the barber or the boots is on
him for his wages; and perhaps the rich man
would be worse put to it by the absence of
the boots, than the boots by the absence of
the rich man. Generally, we believe, the
higher we are in position, the more masters
we have to serve, and the less considerate;
and we have little doubt that even our brilliant
and gentle authoress herself has more
and less amiable behests to obey, than ever
fell to the lot of the independent help, who
"<i>thought she heard her yell</i>."</p>

<p>We have dwelt longer on this point than
its weight or merit, as regards the volume,
of which it occupies but a page, would seem
to justify; and we have done so not ill-naturedly,
to pick out the one tare from the
load of wheat, but merely to controvert what
we consider a dangerous social fallacy, which
is growing and gaining virulence and vigor
under false treatment, and producing serious
detriment to a large class of our population.
The volume itself is, as we have observed, an
entertaining, an instructive, emphatically a
good one; and its getting up and embellishment
reflect as much credit on the publishers,
as its contents on the author. It is one of
the most beautiful, and deserves to be one of
the most popular, gift-books of the season.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the most agreeable republications
of the season we may cite Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lee's</span> <i>Luther
and his Times</i>, the <i>Life and Times of Cranmer</i>,
and the <i>Historical Sketches of the Old
Painters</i>, recently issued in the Family Library
of Willis Hazard, of Philadelphia. <i>Luther and
his Times</i> appears at an appropriate period, considering
the great number of works relating
to the Reformer which have been written in
England and on the continent: scarce any of
which, however, are superior to this, either
in accuracy or general interest. As an appropriate
companion to it we have Cranmer&mdash;a
plain, straightforward, and withal extremely
attractive account of the Reformation
in England. With regard to the relative
excellence of these, we incline to the
Luther. The simplicity and singleness of
style which characterize Mrs. Lee's biography
of Cranmer, would render it peculiarly
the property of the young, were it not that
the great amount of valuable historical information
which it contains, as well as the fact
that so little is generally known relative to
the early history of the English Reformation,
commend it equally to the perusal of older
and graver students. But in the Luther, we
have, in the best sense, a <i>literary</i> work, one
in which ease of style, an almost romantic
interest and accurate research, combine to
invest it with that variety of excellence which
the public taste at the present day requires
of the historian and biographer. The works
are neatly got up, with fair illustrations. In
the same series we also find an illustrated
edition of <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>. A curious
proof of the exquisite simplicity and
beauty of style which characterize this work,
may be found in the fact, that throughout
Germany, Scandinavia, and Italy, no English
work is so well known or so extensively used
in the study of our language.</p>

<p>Few American works have conferred on
their writers a more respectable reputation
than Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lee's</span> <i>Historical Sketches of the Old
Painters</i>. When we reflect on the important
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> which a knowledge of Art plays in a
modern education, and that the time is evidently
not distant when the <i>&AElig;sthetics</i> will
form as essential a portion of school courses
as French or Algebra, we cannot be too grateful
to one who has prepared such an eminently
practical yet agreeable introduction to
such studies. To the general reader who
lacks the time or patience to work his way
through the interminable works of Vasari,
Kugler, or Lanzi, and who can be satisfied
with an account of the most eminent painters,
narrated in a concise yet highly interesting
manner, this work must be invaluable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</a></span></p>

<p>We have looked over an edition of <span class="smcap">Young's</span>
<i>Night Thoughts</i>, edited by <span class="smcap">James Robert
Boyd</span>, and published by Mr. Scribner. It
reminds us of that edition of Milton, by some
eastern gentleman (there is a copy in the
Harvard College library), in which "the
versification is somewhat improved, and for
better effect a few new figures are put in here
and there." Except that memorable specimen
of editorial silliness and sacrilege, we
must confess&mdash;nay, we gladly confess&mdash;that
we have never seen or heard of any thing
worse than this very handsomely printed edition
of Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>. As the respectable
publisher of it must have supposed
Mr. Boyd possessed of some qualifications for
the task undertaken by him, we will be a little
more particular than is our wont, and
convince him, and convince that part of the
public which reads this magazine, that Mr.
Boyd's edition of Young is an unendurable
imposition. Dr. Young was a writer of singular
naturalness of feeling and simplicity of
style. As has frequently been observed of
his works, lacking the romantic passion and
fiery impulse which would commend them
most to the tastes of middle life, they are the
chosen companions of youth and age. There
has scarcely ever been a poet who so little
needed annotation; his "great argument,"
indeed, sometimes might be more easily apprehended
if a little simplified by a clear-headed
schoolman, but his verbal transparency
is such that he needs, in this respect,
no tinkering whatever. Yet Mr. Boyd makes
nearly half his book of notes, and of notes,
too, in which the great purpose of the poem
is never touched&mdash;notes composed of mere
platitudes, as useless, meaningless, and ridiculous,
as would be the repetition of Swift's
"nonsense verses" in the margin of every
page. We copy at random a few examples:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wake: how happy they who wake no more!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> "<i>I wake.</i>" This expression suggested to the poet the expressive
contrast, "How happy they who wake no more."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A mind that fain would wander from its woe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Fain</i>: gladly.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Teach my best reason, reason; my best will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teach rectitude.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Teach</i>, &amp;c. Teach my best reason what is reasonable: cause
the best actings of my intellectual powers to be more strictly conformed
to what is reasonable, true, and fit.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">We take no note of Time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from its loss: to give it then a tongue.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>To give it then a tongue.</i> To cause time to speak to us!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here teems with revolutions every hour.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Here</i>, &amp;c. On this earth every hour teems with revolutions!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I would not damp, but to secure, thy joys.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>But to secure</i>, &amp;c. But with a view to secure thy joys!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No moment, but in purchase of its worth.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Of its worth</i>: Of something equally valuable!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nature, in zeal for human amity.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>In zeal for human amity</i>: In the exercise of zeal for encouraging
human friendship!</p></div>

<p>And so on through all the book&mdash;scarcely
any thing but these miserable puerilities.
There cannot be a child in the world to whom
the poet's meaning would not be as plain from
the text, as from such notes. In other cases,
where the author is perfectly plain to nearly
the meanest apprehensions, Mr. Boyd himself
cannot understand him; for instance:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While o'er my limbs sleep's soft dominion spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though my soul fantastic measures trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er fairy fields, or mourned along the gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pathless woods, or, down the craggy steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurl'd headlong, swam with pain the mantled flood.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The obvious idea in these last lines is, that,
hurled down into a pool, battlemented, or
<i>mantled</i> about, he swam with pain, seeing no
egress up the craggy or precipitous rocks: a
use of the word "mantled," which is justified
by instances in many of the best ancient and
modern writers. But Mr. Boyd reduces the
lines to the poorest stuff by the following</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Mantled</i>: Expanded, spread out, as a mantle.</p></div>

<p>An instance of his prosaic feebleness occurs
on page 86.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thought, busy thought, too busy for my peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the dark postern of long time elapsed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led softly, by the stillness of the night....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In quest of wretchedness perversely strays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And finds all desert now, and meets the ghosts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my departed joys, a numerous train.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> <i>Ghosts of my departed days</i>: The bare recollection of them!</p></div>

<p>This is a new exhibition of the "art of
sinking." The whole commentary suggests
the idea of making a noble poem contemptible,
by covering it over with diminutive conceits
and bungling impertinences.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Injustice to the South</span>," is everywhere
a fruitful subject of discussion. In politics, in
religion, in letters, our friends beyond Washington
will not believe us in the North capable
of treating them with fairness. In literature
we have constantly heard it alleged that
success should never be dreamed of by an author
who had the misfortune to be born the
wrong side of Mason and Dixon's line. The
superstition is not without its uses. It affords
abundant consolation to a vast number of
young gentleman whose books produce no
profits. Yet we are inclined to believe it is
altogether without any foundation in reason;
that <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> would have been as
popular from Charleston as from Concord.
We have an amusing illustration of the feeling
on this point, in the last <i>Southern Literary
Messenger</i>. The amiable and eminently accomplished
editor of that work counts among
his personal friends as many northern gentlemen
as have had ever opportunity to know
him, yet he honestly believes us incapable of
appreciating the genius of a poet from one of
the tobacco, sugar, or cotton states. Introducing
some pretty verses entitled <i>The Marriage
of the Sun and Moon</i>, "by the late H. S.
Ellenwood, of North Carolina," into his
last number, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Had the gifted author been a native of Massachusetts,
his name would be familiar as household words; as it is, we
doubt whether one in ten of our readers has ever heard of it."</p></div>

<p>He <i>was</i> a native of Massachusetts. His original
name was Small, and he was born in Salem,
in the year of grace 1790; at sixteen apprenticed
to J. T. Buckingham, of Boston; at
twenty-one had his name changed to H. S. Ellenwood;
in 1820 emigrated to North Carolina;
and on the 2d of April, 1843, he died, in
Wilmington, in that state, having just established
there the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>. We suspect
that, in literature at least, all charges of "injustice
to the South," are as ill founded as this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>American Gift Books</i> for the present
season surpass any hitherto published, both
as regards literature and art. The <i>Home
Book of the Picturesque</i>, published by Mr.
Putnam, is the finest combination of all needful
qualities for such a work, that has ever
appeared in the English language. The late
Fenimore Cooper (of whose admirable article
we publish a large portion in preceding pages),
Miss Susan Fenimore Cooper, Washington
Irving, W. C. Bryant, N. P. Willis, Alfred B.
Street, Bayard Taylor, and Dr. Bethune, are
among the contributors, and Durand, Huntington,
Cole, Cropsey, &amp;c., furnish pictures,
from the most striking, beautiful, and least-known
scenery in America. The publishers
of the world do not this year furnish a volume
more admirable. The <i>Book of Home
Beauty</i>, containing exquisitely engraved portraits
of some of the most distinguished women
in American society, by Charles Martin,
with letter-press by Mrs. Kirkland, is
another fine quarto; and <i>The Memorial</i>, an
octavo, written by Nathanael Hawthorne, N.
P. Willis, G. P. R. James, R. B. Kimball, Dr.
Mayo, W. G. Simms, Mrs. Hewitt, Mrs. Oakes
Smith, and others, is very much above any
"Keepsake" or "Souvenir" ever before printed
in England or in America.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have new volumes of Poems, by Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Longfellow</span>, <span class="smcap">Bayard Taylor</span>, and R. H.
<span class="smcap">Stoddard</span>, from the press of Ticknor, Reed,
and Fields, of which appropriate notices are
deferred until the next month.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. Appleton</span> have a series of works,
equally remarkable for typographical and
pictorial magnificence and literary interest.
<i>Christmas with the Poets</i> is admitted to be,
on the whole, the most admirably executed
production of the printing press; <i>The Women
of Early Christianity</i>, written by eminent
authors, and edited by the Rev. Mr. Spencer,
presents attractively the domestic romance
of religious history, with seventeen very excellent
engravings, making an imperial octavo,
in the style of that remarkably popular
series, the <i>Women of the Bible</i>, the <i>Women of
the Old and New Testament</i>, and <i>Our Saviour
with Prophets and Apostles</i>, all of which
are now published in styles to suit the cabinet
of art, the drawing-room table, or the library.
Another very interesting and richly illustrated
work from this house is <i>The Land of
Bondage</i>, by Dr. Wainwright, corresponding
with the same author's splendid volume, <i>The
Pathways and Abiding Places of Our Lord</i>.
The Appletons also publish for the coming
holidays Mrs. Jameson's most successful
work, the <i>Beauties of the Court of Charles
the Second</i>, with twenty-one finely engraved
portraits, and <i>The Queens of England</i>, by
Agnes Strickland, with eighteen portraits&mdash;a
work of which the fame is as extensive as a
love of art or an admiration of woman; and
<i>Lyrics of the Heart</i>, a very finely illustrated collection
of the poems of Alaric A. Watts. The
other illustrated works from this house are
enumerated in the advertising pages at the end
of this magazine, to which we ask attention.</p>

<p>A series of four compositions representing

<h2><a name="Historical_Review_of_the_Month" id="Historical_Review_of_the_Month">Historical Review of the Month.</a></h2>


<p>On the 4th of November the state election in
New York resulted in the choice of all but two
of the democratic candidates, and the defeat of the
whigs on the great question respecting the canals.
The closeness of the vote may be inferred from
the majorities: For <i>Controller</i>, Wright over Patterson
527; <i>Secretary of State</i>, Randall over Forsyth
1420; <i>Treasurer</i>, Cook (whig) over Welch,
64; <i>Attorney General</i>, Chatfield over Ullmann,
294; <i>Canal Commissioner</i>, Fitzhugh (whig) over
Wheaton, 745; <i>State Engineer</i>, McAlpine over
Seymour, 2390. In New Jersey, on the same
day, a large majority of the legislature was elected
by the democrats. In Delaware, on the same
day, it was determined to hold a convention for
revising the constitution of the state, by 2,129 majority.
In Louisiana, on the 3d, the whigs carried
the legislature, and gained one member of Congress
(Moore over Morse). In Wisconsin the
whigs have elected Farwell, their candidate for
Governor, and a majority of the legislature.
Maryland, on the 5th, the entire democratic
ticket, for comptroller, register, &amp;c., was elected,
with a majority of the legislature. In Michigan, the
same day, the democrats, as usual, carried nearly
every thing. In Massachusetts, on the 10th, there
was a failure to elect a governor, but numerous
vacancies to be filled in the legislature, it
is supposed at this time (20th), will enable the
whigs to succeed in that body. The vote was the
largest ever thrown in the State. In Mississippi,
Mr. Foote's majority is about 1500. In Tennessee,
ex-Governor James C. Jones (whig), was elected
to the United States Senate on the 14th. In Georgia,
the new legislature assembled on the 3d, Governor
Cobb was inaugurated on the 5th, and Mr.
Toombs, now representative in Congress, was
chosen United States Senator on the 10th. He is
a Southern Rights Whig Unionist, and succeeds
Mr. Burrien.</p>

<p>A correspondence has taken place between the
Spanish minister at Washington and the Secretary
of State, which, it is understood, assures a settlement
of the difficulties arising from the invasion of
Cuba; but additional discontent has been occasioned
by the arrest, imprisonment, trial, and sentence
(on the 12th of November), at Havana, of
an American citizen, John G. Thrasher, for "disloyalty,"
to eight years hard labor in a Spanish
fortress. Mr. Thrasher is a native of Maine, and
had been for several years editor of the <i>Faro Industrial</i>,
at Havana.</p>

<p>Judge Kane, in the Circuit Court of Pennsylvania,
has given his decision in the Telegraph Case,
sustaining Morse's pretensions throughout, and
against Bain. The decision is in favor of Morse
on all points, and establishes that he is solely entitled
to the art of instantaneously recording messages
at a distance. The case will now go to the
Supreme Court, with probably the same result.</p>

<p>The great Methodist Episcopal Church case was
decided on the 11th of November, in the United
States District Court, in favor of the Southern
claimants. The sum in dispute was $750,000&mdash;being
the amount at which the Book Concern of
the Society is estimated&mdash;and the decision gives
to the Methodist Church South its proportion of
this property.</p>

<p>In the United States District Court, at Philadelphia,
on the 7th November, the Grand Jury
presented seventy-eight indictments against thirty-nine
of the participants in the riot at Christiana.
Each of the accused is charged with high treason.</p>

<p>Efforts for the separation of California into new
states are vigorously prosecuted. The latest intelligence
from the mines is favorable. Oregon
will probably come into the Union as two states.</p>

<p>There have been a great number of fatal accidents
in the last few weeks, of which we can give

<p>On the 21st October, a serious difficulty broke
out at Chagres, between the American and native
boatmen, and a battle ensued, which resulted in
the death of two Americans, and as many natives.
After two days' disturbance, the affair was adjusted,
and order restored.</p>

<p>In Mexico, for the present, the insurrection of Caravajal
has failed, and the siege of Matamoras has
been abandoned. In New Grenada the Jesuit revolt
under Borrero has been put down and Borrero
captured. From Buenos Ayres we learn that General
Oribe has been overthrown, and that Rosas is
in the utmost danger, but the results of recent important
events there are not yet well understood.</p>

<p>Little has occurred in Great Britain, of much
importance, except the demonstrations occasioned
by the arrival of Kossuth, at Southampton, on the
23d of October. The Hungarian chief has been
received with unparalleled enthusiasm in Southampton,
London, Manchester, and elsewhere, and
in many long and powerful speeches has vindicated
his great reputation for wisdom and for honest
devotion to the liberties of his country. He
was to leave England in the steamer Washington,
for New-York, on the 14th November, and will
probably have arrived here before this paragraph
is published. In the United States a triumph
even more enthusiastic than that in England
awaits him. The Caffre war in South Africa is
still extending, and the British forces have obtained,
in no case, decided or important advantages.</p>

<p>The attention of Europe is more than ever concentrated
on France. Louis Napoleon, who had
deprived the nation of the right of suffrage, in despair
of re&euml;lection by any other means finally determined
on the abrogation of the restricting law
of the 31st of May; his ministers resigned; after
a considerable period a new ministry, with little
weight of personal character, was formed; and on
the 4th of November the new session of the French
Legislative Assembly was opened in Paris, to receive
the President's Message, and at once to vote
down its cardinal recommendations. The world
watching with deep interest that conflict of the
factions in France which must be brought to a close
with the present term of her unscrupulous ruler.</p>

<h2><a name="Recent_Deaths" id="Recent_Deaths">Recent Deaths.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Archibald Alexander</span>, D.D., LL. D., late Professor
of Theology in the Seminary of the Presbyterian
Church at Princeton, in New Jersey, was
born on the 17th of April, 1772, on the banks of
a small tributary of the James River, called South
River, and near the western foot of the Blue Ridge,
in that part of Augusta County, Virginia, which
has since, from the great natural curiosity it contains,
been named Rockbridge. He was descended
by both parents from Presbyterians of Scotland,
who emigrated first to Ireland, and thence to America.
He was educated at Liberty Hall Academy,
which has since become Washington College, under
the instructions of the founder of that institution,
Rev. William Graham, an able and eminent
preacher and professor. Besides Mr. Graham, his
classical teachers were James Priestly, afterward
President of Cumberland College, Tennessee, and
Archibald Roane, afterward Governor of Tennessee.
In the summer of 1789, he joined in the
full communion of the church, and commenced
the study of theology under Mr. Graham, who
had a class of six or eight students. He was licensed
to preach by this Presbytery of Lexington,
October 1, 1791, and was ordained on the 5th of
May, 1795. Part of the intervening years he
spent in itinerant labors in Virginia, and in that
region which is now Ohio. In the spring of 1797
he became President of Hampden Sydney College,
in the County of Prince Edward, at the
same time being pastor of the churches of Briery
and Cumberland. He was now but twenty-five
years old, and it may safely be alleged that there
was never won in this country, at so early an age,
a more brilliant or a purer reputation. His arduous
and responsible duties were discharged with
industry and energy, equal to his abilities, until
health gave way, and, in the spring of 1801, he resigned
these charges, in well-grounded apprehension
of a settled pulmonary consumption. The
summer of 1802 was spent by Mr. Alexander in
travelling on horseback through New England, and
by this means he so far recovered his health as to
resume the Presidency of the College and the
charge of his parishes. About the same time he
was married to Janette Waddell, second daughter
of Rev. Jonas Waddell, D.D., that remarkable
preacher whose blindness and eloquence have
been celebrated by Mr. Wirt in <i>The British Spy</i>.
In the Autumn of 1806 he received a call from
the Third Presbyterian Church, at the corner of
Pine and Fourth-sts., in Philadelphia. Though
he had declined an invitation to the same church
ten years before, he accepted this, and thus became
a second time the successor of the Rev.
John Blair Smith, D.D. He continued at this
post until, in the spring of 1812, he was summoned
by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church to be the first Professor in the
Theological Seminary then just founded at Princeton.
This chair, we believe, he occupied until his
death&mdash;until within a few weeks, at least, discharging
all its honorable duties. It is a pleasing
fact that the first two Professors in this Institution
were associated in its service nearly forty years.
During this period a large number of clergymen
have proceeded from the seminary, and it has now
not far from one hundred and fifty students. It
is important to observe that it has no connection
with the College of New Jersey, at the same place.
The eminent usefulness of Dr. Alexander is not to
be measured by the long and wise discharge of
his duties as a professor. He was a voluminous,
very able and popular writer. In addition
to occasional sermons and discourses, and numerous
smaller treatises, he wrote constantly for
<i>The Princeton Review</i>, a quarterly miscellany of
literature, and theological and general learning,
of the highest character, which is now in the
twenty-seventh year of its publication. His work
on <i>The Evidences of the Christian Religion</i> has
passed through numerous editions in Great
Britain as well as in America, and this, as well as
his <i>Treatise on the Canon of Scripture</i>, which has
also been republished abroad, we believe, has appeared
in two or three other languages. The substance
of the latter has, however, been incorporated
with more recent editions of the former, under
the title of <i>Evidences of the Authenticity, Inspiration
and Canonical Authority of the Holy Scriptures</i>,
of which a fifth edition&mdash;the last we have
seen&mdash;was published in Philadelphia in 1847.
Among his other works are <i>Thoughts on Religion;
a Compend of Bible Truth</i>; and a <i>History of
Colonization on the Western Coast of Africa</i>&mdash;the
last an octavo volume of more than six hundred
pages, published in Philadelphia in 1846.
His principal writings, however, have been on
practical religion and on the History and Biography
of the Church, and these for the most part have
been published anonymously. Dr. Alexander was
the father of six sons, of whom three are clergymen.
The eldest, James W. Alexander, D.D.,
for several years Professor in the College of New
Jersey, and sometime Pastor of the Duane-street
Church in this city, is a fine scholar and an able
preacher, and has enrolled himself among the benefactors
of the people by many writings of the
highest practical value designed to elevate the
condition of the laboring classes to the true dignity
of citizenship and a Christian life. Another
is Rev. Joseph Addison Alexander, D.D., Professor
of Oriental Literature in the Theological
Seminary at Princeton, and author of the well-known
works on the Earlier and the Later Prophecies
of Isaiah. He is generally regarded as
one of the most profound and sagacious scholars
of the present age. The late venerable Professor
was undoubtedly one of those who, by the union
of a most Christian spirit and a faultless life to
great abilities, have been deserving of the praise of
doing most for the advancement of true religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. J. Kearney Rogers</span>, for a long time one of
the most able and respected physicians and surgeons
of New-York, died on the 9th of November.
He was born in New-York in 1793, graduated at
Princeton in 1811, studied medicine in Edinburgh,
London, and Paris, and returning to New York
was the friend and associate of Dr. Post, Dr. Hossack,
Dr. Francis, Dr. Delafield, and other eminent
members of his profession, in establishing medical
and surgical institutions, &amp;c. He has left no writings
in print or MS. for the public.</p>

<p>The Rev. <span class="smcap">William Croswell</span>, D.D., Rector
of the Church of the Advent, in Boston, died in
that city very suddenly, on the evening of Sunday,
November 9, having preached and administered
the sacrament of baptism during the day. Dr.
Croswell was born in New-Haven, Connecticut,
on the 7th of November, 1804, was the son of
the Rev. Dr. Croswell of that city, and was educated
at Yale College, where he was graduated
in the summer of 1824. He was subsequently,
for two years, associated with Dr. <span class="smcap">Doane</span>, now
Bishop of New Jersey, in the editorship of the
<i>Episcopal Watchman</i> at Hartford, after which
he removed to Boston, and was for several years
minister of Christ's Church, in that city. He then
became rector of St. Peter's, in Auburn, New
York, and at length returned to Boston, where his
numerous warm friends gladly welcomed his settlement
as minister of the Church of the Advent. Dr.
Croswell was a scholar, and possessed a fine taste
in literature, with very unusual powers as a writer.
Among his poems, are many of remarkable grace
and sweetness, and a few evincing a happy vein
of satire. His poems are nearly all religious, and
Bishop <span class="smcap">Doane</span>, in a note to his edition of Keble's
"Christian Year," remarks that "he has more unwritten
poetry in him" than any man he knows.
We hope Bishop Doane will commemorate his
friendship, and the genius and virtues of Dr.
Croswell, in a memoir, and collection of his works.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Granville Sharpe Pattison</span>, an eminent
teacher of anatomy, died in New York, after a
short illness, on the 12th of November, in the
sixty-first year of his age. He was born near
Glasgow, in Scotland, where his father was a cotton
spinner, and was educated in that city, studying
surgery under the late eminent Professor
John Burns. On obtaining his degree, he commenced
the practice of his profession in Glasgow,
with prospects of eminent success, and soon became
one of the surgeons of the Andersonian Institution,
and a lecturer on anatomy. An unfortunate
domestic affair, of which the details may
be learned from the report of a trial which resulted
in the divorce of Prof. Andrew Ure from
his wife, in 1819, caused Dr. Pattison to come to
the United States. He settled in Baltimore,
where he resumed his profession as a lecturer on
anatomy; and, going afterwards to England, he
became a professor in the medical school connected
with the London University. He continued
but a short time in England, and on returning to
this country he accepted the place of Professor of
Anatomy in the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia,
which he filled successfully until 1840,
when he was made Professor of Anatomy in the
Medical School connected with the New-York
University&mdash;an office which he held until his
death, having delivered his last lecture but a
week before that event. Dr. Pattison was a man
of fine social qualities, and was one of the best
lecturers in this country. His published writings
display the best capacities for his vocation&mdash;are
shrewd, judicious, and happily delivered&mdash;but for
the most part fragmentary. His editions of Cruveilhier's
<i>Anatomy of the Human Body</i>, Mase's
<i>Anatomical Atlas</i>, and other works, are well
known, and he wrote many important papers in
the American Medical Recorder, besides several
pamphlets of a personal character.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Stephens</span>, the author of "Martinuzzi," and
the "Manuscripts of Erdely," died on the 8th of
October, in Camden-town. He was in his fifty-first
year, and, in early life, had produced several
tragic dramas that commanded the attention of
critics, both foreign and native. Schlegel abroad,
and "minor Beddoes" at home, praised his tragedies
of "Montezuma" and the "Vampire;" and, at
a later period, his "Gertrude and Beatrice" excited,
among the few who take an interest in dramatic
poetry, great admiration. His last work
consisted of "Dramas for the Stage," in two volumes,
but it was only privately circulated. Mr.
Stephens' dramatic poetry was distinguished by
intense passion and fervor; but at the early part
of his career, he lacked the constructive power.
Finding that the stage monopoly, so long existing,
was an effectual bar to the higher original drama
being produced, he joined, about the year 1841, a
guild of zealous literary young men, who were
bent on doing something towards theatrical reform.
Mrs. Warner and Mr. Phelps united themselves
to these dramatic aspirants; and the result was,
that the Lyceum Theatre was taken for a month,
for the performance of a new five-act tragedy, notwithstanding
the existing law to the contrary. The
tragedy was licensed as an opera in three acts,
and was at length acted with some of the songs
retained. This retention of musical irrelevancies,
in obedience to the law, while it made the law itself
absurd, could not fail of injuring the drama
in which they were introduced; and, had its merits
not been extraordinary, "Martinuzzi," under
such circumstances, could not have lived a single
night. As it was, it struggled through the month,
making partisans to the experiment, though at the
sacrifice of the author's means and feelings. Mr.
Stephens accepted the martyrdom freely, and
went through it nobly, for the sake of the cause
which to his death he held sacred. Moreover, he
would have continued the contest, but that he was
strongly advised to the contrary by Mr. Sheridan
Knowles, and Mr. John A. Heraud, the latter of
whom had been actively engaged in getting up
"Martinuzzi," but thought that sufficient demonstration
had been made. In this he was right, as
it subsequently proved; for, shortly after, in conjunction
with Mr. Edward Mayhew and some other
gentlemen, he was a party to the drawing up, in
committee, of a bill for the liberation of the stage,
the draft of which was forwarded to Sir Robert
Peel, who placed it in the hands of Lord Mahon,
by whom it was carried through Parliament; and
thus every theatre was enabled legally to perform
the Shakspearian and five-act drama. Mr. George
Stephens himself, sick of dramatic disappointment,
turned his ardent mind into a new channel, and
became involved in railway speculations, and in
them lost his fortune. His latter days were accordingly
passed in narrow circumstances, accompanied
with physical prostration quite deplorable.
They who had benefited by his exertions, neglected
him. His love for the drama and power of
composition remained uninjured, but encouragement
attached itself to younger candidates. His
high principle, determined courage, personal pride
and fortitude, however, continued with him to the
last; and as he was a pious and religious man, he
bore suffering and neglect not only with patience,
but with confidence that the good cause in which
he had labored would ultimately prosper.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The celebrated missionary <span class="smcap">Charles Gutzlaff</span>,
of whom we gave an interesting account in the
<i>International</i> last year (vol. i. 317), died at Canton
on the 9th of August, in the forty-eighth year
of his age. He was born on the 8th of July, 1803,
at Pyritz, in the Prussian province of Pomerania,
of parents whose very moderate circumstances
prevented them from affording him the education
requisite for a Christian missionary, to become
which was his most anxious desire. After attending
for some time the schools of his native town,
he was sent to Stettin as an apprentice to a belt-maker.
There he composed a short poem, in
which he expressed his strong religious feelings,
with his hitherto unavailing wishes respecting his
career in life, and which he presented to the king
of Prussia, on occasion of a visit paid by the latter
to Stettin, in 1821. The effect of this step was
to procure his admission as a pupil into the missionary
institution at Berlin. Such was the progress
which he made in his studies, that only two
years afterwards, in the spring of the year 1823,
he was judged to be sufficiently qualified for the
object he had in view. He was sent to the Dutch
Missionary Society at Rotterdam, which appointed
him to be one of their missionaries to the East.
But becoming more than ever sensible of the arduousness
of the functions he had undertaken to
perform, he did not venture to embark for his destination
until the month of August, 1826, having
devoted himself, in the mean time, to a further
diligent preparation for future usefulness. The
first missionary ground assigned him was in the
island of Java. He took up his residence at Batavia,
where he married an English woman who
was possessed of considerable property, and where,
by mingling with the Chinese inhabitants, in the
course of two years he acquired so skilful a use
of their language, and became so intimately acquainted
with their modes of life and intercourse
with each other, as to be adopted by them into
one of their families, and to have a Chinese name
assigned to him. The circumstances just mentioned
produced an important change in his plans.
In the possession, as he now was, of a pecuniary
independence, he resolved to break off his connection
with the Dutch missionary society, and to proceed
to China, to preach the gospel to the Chinese
in their own country, to the extent that he might
be allowed to do so. In the first place, however,
he accompanied an English missionary, named
Tomlin, to Siam, in the summer of 1828. This
journey occupied Gutzlaff for a period of upwards
of three years. Besides laboring diligently in his
vocation as a Christian minister, he composed,
while residing at Bankok, a Siamese grammar,
and, in conjunction with Tomlin, translated the New
Testament into the Siamese language. He next
proceeded to China, where, associating himself
with Morrison, Medhurst, and other European missionaries,
he selected Macao for his principal station.
He established schools, distributed religious
tracts among the people, assisted in a new translation
of the Bible into Chinese, co-operated with
Morrison in founding a society for the diffusion of
useful knowledge in China, published a Chinese
Monthly Magazine, and yet did not neglect, at
Macao, and in various excursions made from that
place, the preaching of Christianity to the inhabitants.
All this went on without any hindrance,
until Gutzlaff excited the suspicion of the Chinese
authorities of his labors being in some way connected
with the interested views of the English
traders; and, in consequence, an attempt made by
him in May, 1835, to penetrate into the province
of Fokien, proved altogether unsuccessful. The
printing of Chinese books of a Christian character
was now forbidden; the distribution of such books
was obliged to be suspended; and it became necessary
to remove the printing presses from Macao
to Singapore. Thus restricted in his missionary
sphere, Gutzlaff felt himself the more at liberty
to accompany the British expedition against China,
and to be exceedingly serviceable to it by his intimate
acquaintance with the language and customs
of the Chinese. He was also an active agent in
bringing about the treaty of peace, concluded between
the contending parties in 1842.</p>

<p>His literary labors have had an almost incredible
extent and variety. He himself gives the following
enumeration of his writings: "In Dutch I
have written: a History of our Mission and of
Distinguished Missionaries, and an appeal for support
of the Missionary Work; in German: Sketches
of the Minor Prophets; in Latin: the Life of
our Savior; in English: Sketches of Chinese History;
China Opened; Life of Kanghe, together
with a great number of articles on the Religion,
History, Philosophy, Literature and Laws of the
Chinese; in Siamese: a Translation of the New
Testament, with the Psalms, and an English-Siamese
Dictionary, English Cambodian Dictionary
and English-Laos Dictionary. These works I
left to my successors to finish, but with the exception
of the Siamese Dictionary they have added
nothing to them. In Cochin-Chinese: a Complete
Dictionary of Cochin-Chinese-English and English-Cochin-Chinese;
this work is not yet printed.
In Chinese: Forty Tracts, along with three editions
of the Life of our Savior; a Translation of
the New Testament, the third edition of which
I have carried through the press. Of the Translations
of the Old Testament, the Prophets and
the two first books of Moses are completed. In
this language I have also written The Chinese
Scientific Monthly Review, a History of England,
a History of the Jews, a Universal History and
Geography, on Commerce, a Short Account of the
British Empire and its Inhabitants, as well as a
number of smaller articles. In Japanese: a Translation
of the New Testament, and of the first book
of Moses, two tracts, and several scientific pamphlets.
The only paper to which I now send communications
is the Hong-Kong Gazette, the whole
Chinese department of which I have undertaken.
Till 1842 I wrote for the Chinese Archives."</p>

<p>The last year Mr. Gutzlaff spent in Europe, and
he had recently completed some important works,
to be added to the above list, respecting Chinese
affairs and civilization, one of which is a life of the
late Chinese Emperor, with whom the missionary
appears to have had a more intimate personal acquaintance
than was ever yielded to any other
European. The family of Mr. Gutzlaff lately travelled
some time in the United States, where they
were well received in religious circles, and Mr.
Gutzlaff himself felt some disappointment that unlooked-for
duties in Germany prevented him from
extending his tour to the Churches and Universities
of this country. A careful investigation will
show that his long and faithful labors have had a
powerful influence in favor of Christianity in China.</p>

died in Paris on the 4th of October. He was born
at Badejoz, of a noble family, in 1767, at seventeen
years of age he entered the Royal Guards, and being
soon after taken into high favor by the queen
Maria Louisa, of Parma, he became at the end of
the last and beginning of the present century, a
prominent actor in the most important political
events of Spain, of which country, for a time, he
was Minister and absolute ruler. His conduct was
the proximate cause of the Spanish war with Napoleon.
Prince Ferdinand (afterwards Ferdinand
VII.), tired of the thraldom in which he was kept
by his mother and her Minister, applied for protection
to Napoleon; and Godoy, discovering that
he had done so, accused him of a conspiracy to dethrone
his father. This led to the most scandalous
scenes. A revolt broke out at Aranjuez, and
Godoy nearly lost his life. Charles IV. abdicated,
and Ferdinand assumed the sceptre, but the Imperial
ruler of France would not permit him to hold
it. Napoleon took the crown of Spain for his own
family, and the terrible Peninsular war was the
result. The consequence, meanwhile, to Godoy,
was the loss of his wealth and honors, and his
residence in foreign lands for nearly the remainder
of his life. In 1847 the Spanish Minister published
a decree, authorizing Godoy, by his inferior title
of Duke of Alcudia, to return to Spain; and
ordering that a certain portion of his once vast
property should be restored. The latter part of
the decree was acted upon, however, in the same
manner as such restitution's are generally made in
Spain. The only income of Godoy continued to
be an allowance by one of his children. Whatever
may have been the conduct of this singular politician
half a century ago, those who knew him in
his old age could not but admire in him a fine
specimen of the Castilian gentleman. To the very
last he was remarkable for the elegance of his
manners, and high-bred courtesy. In conversation
he was most agreeable. The world, too, should
be charitable to his memory. Years of embarrassment,
exile, poverty, and obscurity, have done
much to atone for the faults committed in a time
of sudden and intoxicating exaltation, and of unbounded
power by him who was then a Prince,
Prime Minister, and despot of Spain, but who has
died, with the weight of eighty-seven years upon
him, a quiet, inoffensive, and forgotten man, in a
retired lodging at Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Baker</span>, the historian of Northamptonshire,
was born and brought up at Northampton.
To him and his gifted sister, Miss Baker, his native
country is deeply indebted. Mr. Baker produced
his learned and comprehensive <i>History of Northamptonshire</i>,
at great expense of money and
time, and at great loss to himself. The book ranks
in the very first grade of topographical literature,
and is remarkable for the perfection of its genealogical
details. Unfortunately, the work is left
unfinished, owing to the ill health of its author and
his want of funds. This amiable and excellent
author and man died at Northampton, on the 12th
of October, in his seventy-first year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thomas Wingard</span>, Archbishop of Upsal
and Primate of Sweden, died at Upsal, on the
24th September, aged seventy. He had for nine
years occupied the chair of Sacred Philology at
Lund, when in 1819 he succeeded his father in
the see of G&ouml;theborg. In 1839, he was promoted
to the archbishopric of Upsal. In 1835, he assisted
in the establishment of the Swedish Missionary
Society, on which occasion he fraternized
with the Methodists at Stockholm. He also addressed
a letter to the Evangelical Alliance, at
its last meeting, regretting his inability to attend.
He has left to the University of Upsal his library,
consisting of upwards of 34,000 volumes, and his
rich collection of coins and medals, and of Scandinavian
antiquities. This is the fourth library bequeathed
to the University of Upsal within the
space of a year, adding to its book-shelves no fewer
than 115,000 volumes. The entire number of volumes
possessed by the University is now said to

novelist, <span class="smcap">Samuel Beaseley</span>, died suddenly, on the
23d of October, at his residence, Tonbridge Castle,
Kent, in his sixty-sixth year, of apoplexy. He
was born in London, and early attached himself
to art, letters, and the stage. The private and

numerous. Among his productions as an author
may be mentioned his novels <i>The Rou&eacute;</i> and <i>The
Oxonians</i>, and his farces of <i>Old Customs</i>, <i>Bachelors'
Wives</i>, <i>Jealous on all Sides</i>, and <i>Is he Jealous?</i>
Mr. Beaseley's merits as an architect were generally
acknowledged; and, although he lived with
great generosity, his talents and industry enabled
him to realize a considerable fortune.</p>

Europe, and especially in Great Britain. Many
of Mr. Borrell's important coins have passed, at

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. James Endell Tyler</span>, B. D., of London,
was a native of Monmouth, and became a distinguished
student and a fellow of of Oriel College,
Oxford. On a particular occasion, he happened
to attract the attention of Lord Liverpool, then
Premier, who, after inquiring, presented him with
the living of St. Giles-in-the-fields. This cure he
filled actively and ably. To the stall in St. Paul's
he was, without his asking, presented by the late
Sir Robert Peel, "to mark," as the Minister said,
"his sense of Mr. Tyler's exertions in the cause of
education at Oxford, and of his exemplary discharge
of his onerous duties at St. Giles's." As
an author, Mr. Tyler gained some celebrity. His

<p><span class="smcap">Emma Martin</span>, a woman well known as a writer,
and as an exemplar of Socialism, died on the
8th of October, at Finchley Common, near London,
in the 39th year of her age. The London
<i>Leader</i>, the organ of the British Socialists, says,
that, "allied to a husband (found in the religious
circle in which she was reared in Bristol) whose company
it was a humiliation to endure, she ultimately,
even when she was the mother of three children,
refused to continue to submit to it. This, though
afterwards made a reproach to her, was so justifiable,
that even her religious friends found no fault
with it. After much struggling to support her
children unaided, she was united to another husband
(Mr. Joshua Hopkins), her former one yet
living. Though no marriage ceremony was performed,
or could be performed (such is the moral
state of our law, which denies divorce to all who
are wronged, if they happen to be also indigent),
yet no affection was ever purer, no union ever
more honorable to both parties, and the whole
range of priest-made marriages never included
one to which happiness belonged more surely, and
upon which respect could dwell more truly. Our
first knowledge of Mrs. Martin," continues the <i>Leader</i>,
"was as an opponent of Socialism, against
which she delivered public lectures. But as soon
as she saw intellectual truth in it, she paused in
her opposition to it. Long and serious was the conflict
the change in her convictions caused her; but
her native love of truth prevailed, and she came
over to the advocacy of that she had so resolutely
and ably assailed. And none who ever offered us
alliance, rendered us greater service, or did it at
greater cost. Beautiful in expression, quick in
wit, strong in will, eloquent in speech, coherent in
conviction, and of stainless character, she was incomparable
among public women. She was one
of the few among the early advocates of English
Socialism who saw <i>that the conflict against religion</i>
could not be confined to an attack on forms
of faith&mdash;to a mere comparison of creeds; and
she attached only secondary importance to the
<i>abuses</i> of Christianity, where she saw that <i>the
whole</i> was an abuse of history, of reason, and of
morality. Thus she was cut off from all hope or
sympathy from her former connections, and she met
with but limited friendships among her new allies.
She saw further than any around her what the
new communism would end in. She saw that it
would establish the healthy despotism of the
affections, in lieu of the factitious tyrannies of
custom and Parliament. The nature of her opinions,
which arose in conviction and not in antagonism,
will best be seen in two passages from her
writings, at two remarkable periods of her life.
In 1835, she wrote in the <i>Bristol Literary Magazine</i>,
which she edited:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'Infidelity is the effusion of weak minds, and the resource
of guilty ones. Like the desolating Simoom of the desert,
it withers every thing within its reach; and as soon as
it has prostrated the morality of the individual, it invades
the civil rights of society.'</p></div>

<p>"In 1844, in the seventh of her <i>Weekly Addresses
to the Inhabitants of London</i>, of which it
was the thirty-sixth thousand issued, she said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'When Christianity arose, it gathered to its standard
the polished Greek, the restless Roman, the barbarous
Saxon; but it was suited only to the age in which it grew.
It had anathemas for the bitter-hearted to hurl at those
they chose to designate God's enemies. It had promises for
the hopeful, cautions for the prudent, charity for the good.
It was all things to all men. It became the grand leader
of the ascetic to the convent&mdash;of the chivalrous to the crusade&mdash;of
the cruel to the Star Chamber&mdash;of the scholar to
the secret midnight cell, there to feed on knowledge, but
not to impart it. But at length its contentional doctrines
bade men look elsewhere for <i>peace</i>&mdash;for some less equivocal
morality, some clearer doctrines, some surer truth.'</p></div>

<p>"In this belief she lived, worked, taught, and in
this belief she died. And in passing to the kingdom
of the inscrutable future, whose credentials
could she better take than those she had won by
her courage and truthfulness? Could she take
Pagan, Buddhist, Mahommedan, Christian, or some
morose sectarian shade; credentials soiled with
age, torn in strifes, stained with blood?... Will
any who calumniate the last hours of Freethinkers
utter the pious fraud over this narrow bed, and the
memory of Emma Martin be distorted, as have
been those of Voltaire and our own Paine? Does
the apparition of these outrages glare upon this
grave&mdash;outrages too ignoble to notice, too painful
to recognize? Heed them not&mdash;believe them not.
Let not the Christian insult her whom only the
grave has vanquished. Let him not utter the
word of triumph over the dead, before whom living
his coward tongue would falter. Let his manliness
teach him truth if his creed has failed to
teach him courtesy. As a worker for human improvement,
Mrs. Martin was as indefatigable as
efficient. From the time when she published her
<i>Exiles of Piedmont</i>, to the issue of her essay on
<i>God's Gifts and Man's Duties</i>, and later still, she
wrote with ardor, always manifesting force of
personal thought, and what is more unusual in the
writings of women&mdash;strength and brevity of expression.
Her lectures were always distinguished
by the <i>instruction</i> they conveyed, and the earnestness
with which they were delivered. In courage
of advocacy and thoroughness of view, no woman
except Frances Wright is to be compared with
her; and only one, whose name is an affectionate
household word in our land (greater, indeed, in
order of power), resembles Mrs. Martin in largeness
and sameness of speculation, and the capacity
to treat womanly and social questions. Mrs.
Martin had a strength of will which rules in all
spheres, but ever chastened by womanly feeling.
Her affectionate nature as much astonished those
who knew her in private, as her resolution often
astonished those who knew her in public. Indeed,
she was the most womanly woman of all the advocates
of "Woman's Rights." Her assertion of
her claim to interfere in public affairs was but a
means of winning security from outrage for the
domestic affections. She would send the mother
into the world&mdash;not in the desertion of motherly
duties, but to learn there what motherly duties
are&mdash;not to submit in ignorance to suckle slaves,
but to learn how to rear free men and intelligent
and pure women."</p>

<p>We have copied thus much of the <i>Leader's</i>
obituary of Mrs. Martin, because a certain unpremeditated
boldness in it admits the reader to instructive
facts in the theory and practice of the
party to which she belonged.</p>

<p>The well-known composer of ballads, &amp;c., <span class="smcap">Alexander
Lee</span>, died near London, suddenly on the
8th of October. He was a son of the once notorious
boxer, Henry Lee, and was married to the late
popular singer, Mrs. Waylett. He at one period
was lessee of Drury Lane Theatre, in partnership
with Captain Polhill. He had been Musical Director
of the Olympic and Strand Theatres, of
Vauxhall Gardens, &amp;c. He wrote the music for
the <i>Invincibles</i>, which had such a run, with Madame
Vestris in the chief part, at Covent Garden,
and afterwards at the American Theatres. To
name his ballads would occupy a large space, for
a more prolific song-writer never existed. We
may mention, however, amongst his works, <i>The
Soldier's Tear</i>; <i>Away, away to the mountain's
brow</i>; <i>Come where the aspens quiver</i>; <i>I'll be no
submissive wife</i>; <i>Rise, gentle moon</i>; <i>Kate Kearney</i>;
<i>Come dwell with me</i>; <i>Pretty star of night</i>;
<i>I've plucked the fairest flower</i>; <i>Bird of love</i>;
<i>Meet me in the willow glen</i>; <i>I'm o'er young to
marry yet</i>; <i>Wha wad na fight for Charlie</i>; <i>When
the dew is on the grass</i>; <i>Down where the blue bells</i>,
&amp;c. Many of these compositions will perpetuate
the name of Alexander Lee as a composer of the
English school of simple and unaffected melody.
We are inclined to believe, more of his songs than
those of any other composer are known in the
United States.</p>

<p>In the fashionable world of this country we have
at length the long-expected "hat of the future,"
from the ingenious artist <span class="smcap">Genin</span>, who appears to
be the only American who brings to the manufacture
of hats an inventive faculty. It is likely that
these hats will gradually take the place of the
funnel and stove-pipe styles which have been so
long in vogue. They are made of fine material,
are light, pliable, durable, and have the more important
merit of elegant and picturesque appearance.
They are indifferently styled the <i>Union
Hat</i>, and the <i>Grandison Hat</i>&mdash;the last name referring
to the ideal of Queen Anne's days.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/i_710.jpg" width="348" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is much doubted whether any of the changes
made in gentlemen's costume in the last half century
are improvements, and there are very few
persons of taste who will approve the hat of the
last few years more than that worn in the good old
times of General Washington, when the three-cornered
chapeau began to give place to such hats
its are represented in our illustration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;">

<p>The next is somewhat more in vogue, at least
for younger men, and for the opera and the theatre.
It sets off a fine-looking face advantageously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;">

<p>The last is better suited for travelling or hunting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span></p>

<p>In Ladies' Fashions, there are some novelties,
though comparatively few of a kind to attract a
large degree of attention. We select for illustration
in the first place&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i_711a.jpg" width="343" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>Close Under-sleeve.</i>&mdash;This sleeve will be found
to be of a very desirable form by ladies who object
to the open sleeves, as it combines the elegant
effect of the latter with the comfort of the
close sleeve. It may be made either in muslin or
net, and is cut as a bishop's sleeve, the fulness being
confined on a band at the wrist. Two broad
frills of lace or needlework are attached to the
lower part of the sleeve. These frills are open in
front of the arm.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;">
<img src="images/i_711b.jpg" width="394" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>Under-sleeve of Lace.</i>&mdash;This sleeve is intended
to be worn for evening dress. The double row of
vandyked lace forming the trimming should drop
below the sleeve of the dress, under which the lace
sleeve is to be worn.</p>

<p>Among the most striking and beautiful articles
in the way of Mantillas, is the <i>Talma</i>, represented
in the following engraving. The capuche is formed
on the model of those worn by the celebrated
monks of St. Francis, and the <i>tout ensemble</i> is
very graceful and beautiful. The entire design is
very well exhibited in the illustration. The Talmas
are made of velvet, silk, satin, and fine cloth.
They have been introduced in New-York by Mr.
Bulpin, of Broadway.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 292px;">

<p>The jacket and waistcoat described in our last
have a certain currency, but are not likely to be universally
adopted. The above costumes, from the
latest <i>modes</i> received from Paris, are in the main
conservative, and the engraving is so distinctive
that the figures scarcely need description.</p>

<p>Black now becomes indispensable in the toilettes
of ladies of fashion; formerly it was exclusively
reserved for days of mourning, A black
dress does not interfere with the robes of varied
colors, and the materials are rich and in good
taste. Jet, in fringes or lace, is worn with all
materials. Upon moire or satin, deep flounces of
chantilly or <i>ruches</i> of lace, placed <i>en tablier</i>, are
much worn; taffetas flounces are cut and stamped
in patterns, or covered with narrow velvets imitating
embroidery. For mantelets, and every species
of outside garments, black will more generally
perhaps than ever before prevail; and rich
furs will have their old prominence for trimming,
particularly for garments of velvet. Fine and
heavy plushes are also being rather largely manufactured
for such purposes.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any change perceptible in the
shape of bonnets, most of the new ones being of
the form which has been generally worn for some
time; yet there is a slight modification of that
shape in bonnets made expressly for the winter.
The front is somewhat less wide and open, and the
bavolet, being rather narrower, droops less at the
back of the head. Of the various materials likely
to be employed for bonnets during the coming
winter, none will be more fashionable than velvet.
Among the velvet bonnets we notice one of violet-colored
velvet trimmed with bows of the same, intermingled
with black lace and jet beads. The
inside trimming consists of velvet pansies, of the
natural color of the flowers, having yellow centres.
With the flowers are combined a few loops
of velvet ribbon of a rich yellow tint, matching the
centre of the flowers. Another bonnet, composed
of dark blue therry velvet, is trimmed with ribbon,
striped with blue and orange. This bonnet
is ornamented in the inside with white flowers.</p>

<p>A Russian winter riding habit is described as
very simple but costly, having a bonnet or hat of
sables or other furs, setting on the head very much
like a chancellor's full wig, and secured by a richly
gemmed bracelet under the chin. The close
coat, and light and flowing mantle nearly concealing
it, are of black or other dark-colored velvet.
This will be in vogue probably only in the intensest
severity of the cold season. Black cloth, embroidered,
is used for the same purpose.</p>
